The vaults literally blasted out
of the solid granite

26
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,774
of Manhattan island.

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,739
Yes, gentlemen,
as my old Scottish grandfather

28
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,863
might have said,
"your money is safer with us

29
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,821
than if it were guarded
by the loch Ness monster herself."

30
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,246
And now if you will follow me
into the executive suite.

31
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,089
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

32
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,094
Oh, miss Serena.
What a sweet name.

33
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,549
Thank you.

34
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,304
I think names have a great
influence on character.

35
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,306
- Don"t you?
- Well, how's that?

36
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,857
A lady named miss Serena
ought to be calm and serene.

37
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,309
- Are you?
- Well, I try to be.

38
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,316
That's good,
because this is a stickup.

39
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,147
Now, ah, don't move.

40
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,198
And don't put your foot
on that alarm button

41
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,241
or I shall be forced
to blast you.

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,868
Dearie, hand me those
nice new stacks of $500 bills.

43
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,827
More.

44
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,873
Ooh.

45
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,552
What are those bills with
dear grover Cleveland's picture

46
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,300
on them? $1000 bills?

47
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,508
Let me have
a handful of those too.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,731
Oh, one more thing.

49
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,151
Which way is the ladies' room?

50
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,112
Thank you, dearie.
You've been very helpful.

51
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,095
Ra-ra-ra!

52
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,549
Three cheers for what? =no!

53
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,759
R-robbed!

54
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,765
Robbed? Someone call Mr. Elcott.

55
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,187
Who did it? Point him out.

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,015
Stand back, everybody.

57
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,841
Not him. Lady.

58
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,844
- Old lady.
- Can you describe her?

59
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,472
- Old, old...
- Calm down, calm down!

60
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,928
Relax. -Old...

61
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,542
Come on,
release the electronic doors.

62
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,165
At once, Mr. Elcott.

63
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,127
Alright, lady, come out
with your hands up.

64
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,880
A gun! That horrible old lady's
got a gun!

65
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,462
A person isn't safe any place
in this rotten city.

66
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,762
You first. I'm not even married.

67
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,435
I couldn't find the button,
Mr. Elcott.

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,458
Mr. Elcott! Mr. Elcott!

69
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,536
They've trapped her
in the ladies' room.

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,131
Alright, little old lady,
are you coming out

71
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,932
or are we coming in?

72
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,528
Nothing.

73
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,156
Do you have a dime?

74
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,871
In deference to your years,
madam

75
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,869
I urge you not to do
anything foolish.

76
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,619
- Nothing.
- I don't get it.

77
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,705
I think I'm beginning to.

78
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,881
Someone lost a coat!

79
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,963
That dame in a yellow suit!
Where is she?

80
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,050
- Let's go!
- Come on, men, get out!

81
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,065
Bergdorf Goodman, please.

82
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,419
Taxi!

83
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,882
How are you?

84
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,096
What seems to be the trouble?

85
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,269
Stickup
at the city federal bank.

86
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,221
Imagine!

87
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,773
Five bandits with machine guns
and tear gas.

88
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,896
No!

89
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,104
Got away
with over 130,000 bucks!

90
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,234
As much as that?

91
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,735
Good gracious.

92
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,487
Mr. Elcott?

93
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,619
Congratulations, you've just
broken the world's record.

94
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,575
Robbed the same day you opened.

95
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,206
Throw this nut out!

96
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,629
He's not a nut.
He's a police lieutenant.

97
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,752
He doesn't sound like
much of a police lieutenant.

98
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,676
And you don't look like
much of a bank president.

99
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,970
And a good bony leg.
Did you notice?

100
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,218
I lost my trouser
defending my bank.

101
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,745
Something that wouldn't
have been necessary

102
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,829
had the police been on the job.

103
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,640
Now, now, Mr. Elcott,
you've got it backwards.

104
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,724
First, there is a bank job,
then there is a police job.

105
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,978
Do you mind lowering your voice?
It's bad for business.

106
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,314
Come inside.

107
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,176
You should have thought of that
before you left

108
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,067
all those $500 and $1000 bills
lying around.

109
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,889
It was a promotional idea
for the opening.

110
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,199
Bank notes of that denomination
aren't readily negotiable.

111
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,746
We have all the serial numbers.

112
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,935
I guess
it would be kind of tough

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,075
trying to break $1000 bill
in an automat.

114
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,706
Yeah, but if they could,

115
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,960
can you imagine
1000 bucks worth of nickels?

116
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,506
I think it's a funny image.

117
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,709
You find grand larceny amusing?

118
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,386
You're tense.
You're much too tense.

119
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,839
Very bad for the digestion.
Relax.

120
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,799
The insurance company,
let them be tense.

121
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,304
They have to make good
your losses.

122
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,915
I'm concerned
with our loss of prestige.

123
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,084
A thing like this could cause
the public to lose confidence.

124
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,939
Well, now, I can't imagine why.

125
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,796
If I were a police, lieutenant,
I think I'd be out looking

126
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,607
for $60,000 carried by a redhead
in a yellow suit.

127
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,233
The odds are, like, 40 to 1

128
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,861
that the redhead is no longer
modeling that particular number.

129
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,513
Here you are, Mr. Elcott.
Right here on film.

130
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,098
Everything that happened
between 2:00 and 3:00.

131
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,953
The robbery took place at 2:47.

132
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,227
We always film the first few days
of a new bank's operation.

133
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,958
- Helps eliminate the bugs.
- Well, talk about dumb luck.

134
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,910
Rothschild, get these down
to the lab.

135
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,916
We're going
to the movies tonight.

136
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,299
Get me Mrs. Elcott.
If she's not at home

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,430
Mrs. Elcott is here, Dr. Mannix.

138
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,059
Send her in.

139
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,520
- Good afternoon, Gregory.
- Good evening.

140
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,694
Oh, Gregory, I'm terribly sorry.
I just couldn't help it.

141
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,362
Things kept happening.

142
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,321
Oh, that feels good.

143
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,532
I've had such a day!

144
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,366
Good day, I hope? Mm.

145
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,874
No more escapism or attempt
to run away from reality?

146
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,877
A little running, yes.
Little escaping too.

147
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,425
Hm. Well, you look so beautiful
this afternoon

148
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,594
I'll try to forgive it.

149
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,674
Gregory, you've never said
anything like that before.

150
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,601
"In the spring,
a young man's fancy?"

151
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,770
Penelope, I am not in love
with you,

152
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,064
nor are you in love with me.

153
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,984
Although at this stage of your
analysis, you may think so.

154
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,352
Oh, I don't think
I'm in love with you.

155
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,486
Oh, you, you don't think
you're in love with me?

156
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,239
No. Never entered my mind.

157
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,910
Why? Are you disappointed?

158
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,583
Not in the least!

159
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,287
In fact, I'm relieved. Oh.

160
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,917
That's good.

161
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,420
So you had
an interesting day, huh?

162
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,212
Care to talk about it?

163
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,219
Well, let's see.

164
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,217
This morning I went shopping

165
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,300
and then I went
to the museum of modern art.

166
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,385
They have a marvelous
new exhibit there.

167
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,434
Then I had lunch
at the, uh, Plaza.

168
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,684
The palm court.

169
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,516
Eggs Benedict.

170
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,819
And then,
a few minutes before 3 o'clock

171
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,147
I stuck up my husband's bank.

172
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,121
Are you asleep?

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,256
No, I...

174
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,210
You're not associating.
You-you realize that?

175
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,760
How do you mean?

176
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,908
I mean, you said
you went shopping.

177
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,243
You went to the museum,
you had lunch.

178
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,757
Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,809
And then you said something
entirely irrelevant.

180
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,603
Gregory, it's you
who's not associating.

181
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,807
All I said was
I stuck up my husband's bank.

182
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,892
You said it again.
But you couldn't possibly.

183
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,987
How do you know?

184
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,674
Because I've been your analyst
for three years.

185
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,841
I know what you're capable of

186
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,526
and I know
what you're not capable of.

187
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,617
Would you like to bet?

188
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,112
My reputation in psychiatry

189
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,943
against anything
you care to put up.

190
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,949
Will this be enough?

191
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,407
What's that?

192
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,542
Well, I think
it's called the loot.

193
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,542
The-the loot?

194
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,793
P-Penelope, would-would you...

195
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,469
So you think
you robbed a bank, huh?

196
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,767
Hm, I've been saying that.

197
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,140
Then I went over to Bergdorf's
and bought this new outfit.

198
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,767
Do you like it?

199
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,144
Penelope, do you expect me
to believe

200
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,066
that you robbed
your husband's bank

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,815
and went blithely
off to Bergdorf's

202
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,612
and spent the loot
on dresses and minks?

203
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,941
- Of course not.
- Well, thank goodness.

204
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,152
No, I wouldn't spend
stolen money.

205
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,406
I have a charge account.

206
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,862
You still insist
you robbed a bank.

207
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,322
Now how could you?

208
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,873
Gregory, it's very simple...

209
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,813
Please, I-l don't wanna hear.
I-l don't want to hear it.

210
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,919
I-I-I-I don't wanna hear
about it.

211
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,631
Oh, of course, that would make
you an accessory after the fact.

212
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,255
Gregory, I'm sorry.
Don't be upset.

213
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,428
We'll just forget
I ever mentioned it.

214
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,596
We're not going to forget
about anything.

215
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,263
H-how much did you get?

216
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,391
That's horrible!

217
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,848
Yeah, but I just counted it.

218
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,478
It's only a little over 60,000.

219
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,025
So it's only half as horrible.

220
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,715
Penelope, nobody can just walk
into a bank

221
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,151
and pick up $60,000
by asking for it.

222
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,823
Of course, you can.
If you have a gun.

223
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,276
You don't own a gun!

224
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,828
Oh, Gregory,
you're always so positive.

225
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,184
What do you think this is?

226
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,750
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was loaded.

227
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,748
I bought it
in the five and dime.

228
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,042
Penelope, this is very bad
for your therapy.

229
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,001
I'm sorry, Gregory.

230
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,430
Somewhere in your analysis,
I have obviously...

231
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,021
Passed up a vital clue.

232
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:05,944
Now I-l want you to tell me
again from the beginning

233
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,112
about the first time
that you took something.

234
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,946
You mean stole something,
don't you?

235
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,823
Gregory, we might
as well face it.

236
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,120
I'm a kleptomaniac.

237
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,324
I refuse to accept
that word clinically.

238
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,662
Now what was the first time?

239
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,342
Well, the very first time...

240
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,886
Was my last week in college.

241
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,964
I was all dressed up
for the senior prom

242
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,390
when Professor Klobb came by.

243
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,310
Professor Klobb taught
anthropology 404.

244
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,197
And he said he'd like
to show me some pictures

245
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,314
of the Okokos tribe
in his laboratory.

246
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,028
He said the Okokos
had some very strange customs.

247
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,989
Well, they certainly did,

248
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,987
but no stranger
than Professor Klobb's.

249
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,125
Oh! Oh!

250
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,586
Oh!

251
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,305
Oh!

252
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,677
Sorry.

253
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,347
Oh!

254
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,897
Ah!

255
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,104
I didn't notice it at first,

256
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,356
but there was something
in my hand.

257
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,187
Somehow,
sometime during our session

258
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,818
in primitive anthropology,

259
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,524
I had grabbed hold
of Professor Klobb's

260
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,281
watch fob, diamond-studded.

261
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,112
I could have sent it back,
of course,

262
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,697
but I decided I'd just keep it

263
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,159
in memory of the strange
customs of the Okokos tribe.

264
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,621
So that's where I began
my life of crime.

265
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,330
Practically by accident.

266
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,382
When was the next incident?

267
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,930
Well, there were some
odds and ends

268
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,848
when I first came to New York.

269
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,178
But then after I met James,
I never stole anything.

270
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,182
Until... until when?

271
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,147
Until my wedding day.

272
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,903
I'll never forget how handsome
James looked that day.

273
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,120
I was terribly in love with him.

274
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,169
But so, it seems, was my matron
of honor, Mildred Halliday.

275
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,871
She wasn't exactly my choice,

276
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,686
but her father was on the board
of the bank.

277
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,344
At the reception,
James suddenly disappeared.

278
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,433
When I came to think about it,

279
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,936
I couldn't seem to locate
Mildred either.

280
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,892
I wasn't suspicious, really,

281
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,978
but I began to wonder
if it wasn't just possible.

282
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,692
It was.

283
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,483
In situations like this,

284
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,035
I always think
of clever things to say.

285
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,737
Well, time to cut the cake.

286
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,538
Hello, Penelope.

287
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,912
Jimmy and I
were just discussing weddings.

288
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,119
Yes, I heard you.

289
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,166
Well, everybody always kisses
the bride,

290
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,748
but-but-but no one thinks
of the groom.

291
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,049
Except you.

292
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,377
Well, it's my generous nature.

293
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,555
Oh, Jim, Jim, look.
You're all over lipstick.

294
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,718
Oh, don't be jealous, love.

295
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,519
Jimmy and I have known
each other for ages.

296
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,642
Ta.

297
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,645
Ta.

298
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,070
I thought briefly
about stabbing her in the back,

299
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,489
but I was afraid the cake knife
wasn't sharp enough.

300
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,692
Would you care
for an explanation?

301
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,995
No, you don't have to.

302
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,452
How was it?

303
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,961
I could take it or leave it.

304
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,004
Have you got
all of her lipstick off?

305
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,253
No, I hope. Why?

306
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,063
In those days, you'd never
suspect James was a banker.

307
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,105
Ready, everybody, ready!
Here they come!

308
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,812
Alright, Penelope,
let's see you hit a future bride.

309
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,989
I can still see Mildred
looking up at me.

310
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,162
She was wearing her
emerald earrings and necklace,

311
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,285
plus a very superior expression.

312
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,077
It was time to toss
the wedding bouquet.

313
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,254
I decided
I'd let Mildred have it.

314
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,505
Oh, Mildred.

315
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,927
Oh, darling, I'm terribly sorry.

316
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,673
Oh, that's good, darling.

317
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,053
Ta.

318
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,099
- Goodbye, my love.
- Goodbye.

319
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,430
And-and-and, darling, darling,

320
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,107
please don't forget to live
happily ever after.

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,981
- I will, bye. Bye.
- Goodbye, James.

322
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,687
- Goodbye, Douglas.
- Bye!

323
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,451
My, my earrings. My earrings!

324
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,029
And when we returned home
ten days later,

325
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,241
the necklace and earrings
were still in the potted palm jar.

326
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,953
- And you never returned them?
- No. Why should 1?

327
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,088
How am I going to help you?

328
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,715
I'm sorry, Gregory.

329
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,887
- I'll try to do better.
- Alright.

330
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,010
Now, I want you to think
very carefully

331
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,591
before you answer this.

332
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,642
Each time you stole something,

333
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,721
do you remember
how you felt afterwards?

334
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,021
Guilty?

335
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,148
Upset?

336
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,146
Depressed.

337
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,568
Disturbed.

338
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,771
Cheerful.

339
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,481
How can you feel cheerful?

340
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,283
Gregory, that's why I'm here.

341
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,282
To try to find out
why stealing makes me cheerful.

342
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,659
You couldn't. You couldn't
possibly feel cheerful.

343
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,118
Which is one fault
that I do not have.

344
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,624
Kleptomania, yes.

345
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,750
Dishonesty, no.

346
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,921
You are not a kleptomaniac.

347
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,749
A kleptomaniac steals
out of compulsion,

348
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,176
but you steal
because you enjoy it.

349
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,104
You're angry with me.
You bet I am.

350
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,831
And we better end this session
right here.

351
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,190
Why? Because I...

352
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,394
Because I find I cannot...

353
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,652
I cannot maintain
a proper attitude of detachment.

354
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,858
And besides, your time is up.

355
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,371
Yes.

356
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,578
Mr. Elcott is calling Mrs. Elcott.

357
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,419
Oh, I wonder
what could be so urgent.

358
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,124
It may have something to do
with his wife sticking up his bank.

359
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,083
Yes, James?

360
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,509
Oh.

361
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,302
He won't be home for dinner.

362
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,800
Why not, darling?

363
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,473
No.

364
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,347
For heaven's sakes.

365
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,474
What?

366
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,806
You have?

367
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,106
When?

368
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,400
Oh, James, can I come?

369
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,897
Oh, thank you, darling.

370
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,571
Yes, yes, yes,
I promise I won't be late.

371
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,818
Gregory, guess what?

372
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,365
They have movies of the robbery,

373
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,818
and James is gonna let me
see them with the police.

374
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,074
I'm on film.
Isn't that exciting?

375
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,451
It's just like an actress
having a screen test.

376
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,285
Except that you get this part,
you're gonna play it in jail.

377
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,619
Gregory, I'd better run.

378
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,330
I've got a thousand things
to do first. Bye.

379
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,682
Thank you, Gregory.
When do I see you again?

380
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,633
With good behavior,
in about 20 years.

381
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,845
Tomorrow, same time. Same time.

382
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,899
Assuming you're still at large.

383
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,123
Dr. Knoblock, I think it's time
we resume my analysis.

384
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,833
You see, I've fallen in love
with this bank robber...

385
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,049
- Oh, may I help you?
- Oh, oui, madame.

386
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,923
I have here a suit
to donate to your charity.

387
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,174
Oh, thank you.

388
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,426
Uh, to whom shall we make out
the receipt?

389
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,351
- Bye.
- It's tax deductible, you know.

390
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,266
Wait a minute.

391
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,727
Wait a minute!

392
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,434
It's gorgeous. I'll take it.

393
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,611
- You are too late!
- Say!

394
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,050
- Oh, please!
- What are you doing?

395
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,032
Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! Ladies!

396
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,952
Such a big commotion. Over what?

397
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,120
Some yellow rag?

398
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,665
The color's all wrong
for your sallow complexion.

399
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:08,337
And yellow?
On a woman of your years?

400
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,460
How much were you going
to pay for this, lady?

401
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,634
Well, uh, uh, $20.
That seems fair.

402
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,963
- 21.
- It's damaged goods. Look.

403
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,174
In that case,
I'm not interested at any price.

404
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,055
Then neither am I.

405
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,470
Oh, dear.

406
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,227
Here's $7.

407
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,060
More than it's worth.

408
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,192
But then I'm such a soft touch.

409
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,363
Oh.

410
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,329
Sadaba, love of my life,

411
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,712
do you know what we have here?

412
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,258
It couldn't be.

413
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,085
But it couldn't be
anything else.

414
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,844
Nobody, nobody does seams
like Givenchy.

415
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,767
A Paris original for $7.

416
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,310
You're a genius.

417
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,854
In love with an angel.

418
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,647
Your rich angel.

419
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,532
In the shop,
we'll get $500 for this.

420
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,655
And a good hanger, six.

421
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,916
Please help the poor.

422
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,547
Please, friends,
open your hearts.

423
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,307
The lord loves a cheerful giver.

424
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,982
Please, friends,
open your hearts.

425
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,980
Help others.

426
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,201
Pardon, monsieur.

427
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,779
It is more blessed
to give than to take, no?

428
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,205
So we've been taught. Yes.

429
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,159
Hm, too bad it is not
the other way around.

430
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,494
Yes.

431
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,931
Thank you. Thank you.

432
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,321
Hey, wait a minute,
I forgot my...

433
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,944
Never mind.

434
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,179
Cracker Jack?

435
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,257
We're coming up
on our first good look

436
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,183
at the suspect right here.

437
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,056
It's about time.

438
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,692
- Now what?
- Oh, it's my wife.

439
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,690
Uh, darling, lieutenant Bixbee.

440
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,693
- How do you do?
- And sergeant Rothschild.

441
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,524
Hello.

442
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,531
Am I, uh, missing anything?

443
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,487
Not from where I'm standin'.

444
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,119
Uh, sergeant,
as long as you're rewinding that

445
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,292
why don't you start
from the top for Mrs. Elcott?

446
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,915
Oh, that's very kind.

447
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,213
- Cracker Jack?
- Thank you.

448
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,130
Thank you.

449
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,551
Your shoes?
Where are your shoes, darling?

450
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,888
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
I left them in the taxi.

451
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,106
Last week,
it was in the elevator.

452
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,062
I could send out
an all-points bulletin.

453
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,760
I hope you have more luck
with my wife's shoes

454
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,220
than you're having
with my bank robbery.

455
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,986
Your bank, my robber. Remember.

456
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,868
Oh, this is so exciting.

457
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,459
James, that's you.

458
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,675
Oh, James, you look so handsome.

459
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,928
When do we get to see the girl?

460
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,130
Right now.

461
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,302
There she is.

462
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,023
Out of the way!

463
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,598
I can't see her!

464
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,684
Oh, maybe there's more.

465
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,610
- Turn around! Turn around!
- Yes, turn around!

466
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,191
Slow down the film.

467
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,200
Oh, she's gone.

468
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,910
Run that part backwards.

469
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,087
Oh, I like that.

470
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,137
Well, that's it.

471
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,313
Suspect, young white female,

472
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,016
5'3", red hair, yellow suit.

473
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,692
Did I forget anything?

474
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,269
Yeah, when viewed from behind,

475
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,650
she has
a very attractive wiggle.

476
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,654
Excuse me, Mrs. Elcott.
-not at all.

477
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,656
Not much help, was it?

478
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,329
No. What a shame.

479
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,032
Everyone else's face
was so clear.

480
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,663
You were very good, James.

481
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,995
And miss Serena
was just fabulous.

482
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,172
Yeah, considering she kept
her mouth open all the time.

483
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,669
Mm.

484
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,503
Incidentally, your cameras
are very strategically located.

485
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:52,181
We weren't expecting to
photograph the ladies' washroom.

486
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,683
Yeah. Bixbee.

487
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,106
Oh, very good.

488
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,438
Our first break in the case.

489
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,896
So soon?
I may have underestimated you.

490
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,107
Good work, officer.

491
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,693
We set up a roadblock
in Times Square.

492
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,124
Lieutenant, how dear of you.

493
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,579
Oh, James,
wasn't that sweet of him?

494
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,913
Adorable.

495
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,544
Lieutenant Bixbee?

496
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,588
I already gave.

497
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,171
Oh, I'm major Higgins.

498
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,756
I'm very busy.

499
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,162
Well, that's a fine way
for a lieutenant

500
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,471
to talk to a major.

501
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,518
Uh, uh, lieutenant,

502
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,724
I was wondering if you could
tell me if this is real.

503
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,810
Excuse me a minute.

504
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,867
Major, where did you get this?

505
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,244
A young lady put it in my
tambourine about 5 o'clock.

506
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,369
Could you describe her?

507
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,745
Her clothes, her coloring?

508
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,122
Her height, her figure?

509
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,857
Uh, Mrs. Elcott,
would you stand up, please?

510
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,337
Oh, of course.

511
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,633
Yes, yes, she was just
about this young lady's height.

512
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,216
And figure.

513
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,058
Only...

514
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,186
Only what?

515
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,894
Only with blond hair.

516
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,067
Anything else? Yes.

517
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,942
She spoke
with a French accent and...

518
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,361
She had a mole on her cheek.

519
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,286
Excuse me. Right here.

520
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,071
Thank you.

521
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,324
Can you remember
anything she said?

522
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,785
Yes, I believe
her exact words were

523
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,089
"it is more blessed to give
than to take, no?"

524
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,087
Oh, we need workers like her.

525
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,214
So willing, so, uh...

526
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,799
Cheerful? Cheerful.

527
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,678
Yes, yes, that's the exact word.
Cheerful.

528
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,884
Yeah, she seemed
such a sweet person.

529
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,393
Isn't the money good?

530
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,600
Well, not for you, major.

531
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,150
This bill was stolen
this afternoon

532
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,102
from Mr. Elcott's bank.

533
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,565
Well, I'm sorry about that.

534
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,490
But I was just hoping.

535
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,496
Oh, well.

536
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,996
Major, wait!

537
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,828
Lieutenant Bixbee,
this is unfair.

538
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,834
It doesn't have to be fair.
It's the law.

539
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,837
What law?
I never heard of any such law.

540
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,213
I mean, why can't he keep it?

541
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,262
After all, he didn't steal it.
Somebody gave it to him.

542
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,465
It wasn't hers to give, darling.

543
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,844
But he needs it.

544
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,222
Isn't there anything you can do?

545
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,644
I'm afraid not.

546
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,309
Well, then, James,
you do something.

547
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,109
Uh, like what?

548
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,859
Write major Higgins a check.

549
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,817
- For what, darling?
- For $1000.

550
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,698
That's what
you're taking from him.

551
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,871
- Taking?
- Well, of course.

552
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,370
And besides,
you'll be breaking even.

553
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,872
How do-how do you
figure that out, darling?

554
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,205
Well, major Higgins
gave you back your $1000.

555
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,336
You give him back his $1000.
Simple.

556
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,091
Am I hearing right?
I can't believe this.

557
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,888
James!

558
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,638
If you don't give
major Higgins a check,

559
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,218
I'll never speak to you again.

560
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,895
Oh, please, folks, please.

561
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,020
We're meant to ease people's
troubles, not to cause them.

562
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,601
I'm sorry.

563
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,270
Please, James.

564
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,002
Oh, thank you, darling.

565
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,923
Five hundred?

566
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,550
A thousand.

567
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,005
A thousand.

568
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,429
Wait till word of this reaches

569
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,307
Red Cross, YMCA and Hadassah.

570
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,069
And do you know what?

571
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:21,025
James still doesn't understand
that he broke even on the deal.

572
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,943
Maybe he was just
being stubborn.

573
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,746
No, he's just confused.

574
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,245
For a banker,
I think that's pretty strange.

575
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,967
Is all this milk good for you?

576
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,755
It's not for me,
it's for my ulcer.

577
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,516
You know,
lieutenant Bixbee was so nice

578
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,514
about getting back my shoes.

579
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,771
Why do you suppose I took this?

580
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,017
Gregory.

581
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,151
Go down the wrong pipe?

582
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,819
Penelope.

583
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,241
Penelope.

584
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,406
Penelope, did you,
did you ever think

585
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,238
of going
to another psychiatrist?

586
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,791
No, that would be disloyal.

587
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,494
I'm not helping you at all.

588
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,714
Of course you are.

589
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,383
Gregory, I'm sorry.
I'll send the wallet back.

590
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,210
It's not only this.

591
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,719
Oh, don't be discouraged
just because I stuck up a bank.

592
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,391
Your husband's bank.

593
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,309
Yeah, James' bank.

594
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,934
Why his bank?
Why not somebody else's bank?

595
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,391
Why are you writing left-handed?

596
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,564
I'm being an accessory
after the fact.

597
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,363
Would you mind
licking this for me?

598
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,162
I'm too dry.

599
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,043
Whatever made you marry a man
like that in the first place?

600
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,590
Oh, James wasn't a man like that
in the first place.

601
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,008
Oh, no.

602
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,762
The first time I met James was
at a Greenwich village cellar

603
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,840
known as the plush pig.

604
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,765
I'd been working there
a couple of months.

605
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,844
It was my first real job
in New York.

The devil's fiddle speaks.

623
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,655
Hi.

624
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,617
- Huh. Miss Penelope Gordon?
- Mm-hm.

625
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,545
If you sit down,
you won't have to scrunch over.

626
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,748
I'd offer you a drink,
but it's only water.

627
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,799
Would you excuse me
while I take out my eyes?

628
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,762
I'm James Elcott,
city federal bank.

629
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,063
Hm, contacts.

630
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,731
Oh, now I can see you
much better.

631
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,359
Well, I never shook hands
with a bank before.

632
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,696
How is it I haven't heard
from you, miss Gordon?

633
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,073
Well, it's probably
because we've only just met.

634
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,747
But I've written you nine times
in the last two months.

635
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,450
Oh, you really love folk songs,
do you?

636
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,207
Not exactly.
No, this is business.

637
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,540
City federal has accepted
trusteeship of a modest estate

638
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,250
left to you
by your mother's cousin.

639
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,506
Are you sure you've got
the right Penelope Gordon?

640
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,597
Absolutely.

641
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,281
The income from the estate
won't be much,

642
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,635
but there are papers to sign.

643
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,468
You're certain you never
received any of my letters?

644
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,974
Ah, I know what happened.

645
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,898
You see, I never open my mail.

646
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,520
Oh, who does it for you?

647
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,727
- Nobody.
- What happens to it?

648
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,984
Well, usually, I stick it away
in a drawer someplace

649
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,693
and then I always forget it
or it gets lost.

650
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,323
Don't you lose
a lot of friends that way?

651
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,996
Oh, no, just the opposite.

652
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,996
You see, if you write me
a letter and I answer it,

653
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,668
then you have to answer mine.

654
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,108
Then I answer your second letter
and you have to write me a third

655
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,247
and answer to my second.

656
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,569
And then I have to write you
a third

657
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,924
and you have to send me
a fourth.

658
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,365
And pretty soon, we're so busy
writing letters to each other

659
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,175
we haven't got time
to be friends.

660
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,054
Isn't that true?

661
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,683
Uh, I-i-l never, I never thought
of it like that, hm.

662
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,231
Well, anyway, I-l could still
look for your letters at home.

663
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,318
Would that help?

664
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,644
Well, we ought
to discuss them, yes.

665
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,063
Oh, dear.

666
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,523
What is it?

667
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,280
I've dropped my contact lens.
I'm always losing them.

668
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,736
Oh, oh,
don't get your pants dirty.

669
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,742
Oh, that's alright.

670
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,495
Do you, um, do you think
we could, uh,

671
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,746
get together sometime tomorrow?

672
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,749
Oh, sure, how about dinner?

673
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,751
I-I'm gonna have
some friends in.

674
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,754
Uh, that's wonderful.

675
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,632
Oh, these contacts,
they're so tiny.

676
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,259
We're never going to find them.

677
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,555
Well, does it matter?

678
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,758
You said yourself,
you can see better without them.

679
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,389
Oh, much better.

680
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,969
I think this optometrist
I was dating

681
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,770
gave me the wrong prescription.

682
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,395
May I ask something?

683
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,401
Why do you wear them?

684
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,695
Well, he said they make
my eyes look luminous.

685
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,070
I think
they're luminous already.

686
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,236
And quite beautiful.

687
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,413
Oh, well, then I don't need
to wear the contacts, do I?

688
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,501
I'm glad you came to see me.

689
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,796
So am I.

690
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,843
I'm looking forward
to tomorrow night.

691
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,762
So am I.

692
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,892
And now I'd like
to get up, please.

693
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,018
Pardon?

694
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,270
You're kneeling on my hair.

695
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,241
- Oh, I'm terribly...
- Oh, watch out for the...

696
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,898
Pipe.

697
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,824
Oh, dear. Oh.

698
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,824
I'm terribly sorry.

699
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:04,915
A-are you alright?

700
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,990
It's alright. Quite alright.

701
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,246
There's nothing
to concern yourself about.

702
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,714
Oh, dear.

703
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,547
Oh, you found my contact lens.

704
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,199
Yeah?

705
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,070
Miss Penelope Gordon?

706
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,871
Is this the bank?

707
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,745
Yes. Shall I come up?

708
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,578
No, but you're welcome down here.

709
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,006
Got it.

710
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,269
I hope I'm not overdressed
for the village.

711
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,725
No, I wouldn't say so.

712
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,685
Come on in and meet everybody.

713
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,563
Everybody, meet James Elcott.

714
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,578
You're dressed funny
for a banker.

715
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,460
- I could go home and change.
- Oh, no, I think it's sweet.

716
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,792
You dressed for us
and we dressed for you.

717
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,427
Penelope, help.

718
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,992
You know these things
make me nervous.

719
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,927
Don't panic, Sebastian.
Help is on the way.

720
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,885
- I'll just be a sec.
- I'm going to hold you to that.

721
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,719
I know you.

722
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,930
Do you bank at city federal?

723
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,390
I bank in my mattress.

724
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,440
Well, that's nice too.

725
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,940
Last night at plush pig,

726
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,521
you walked out on my big number.

727
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,106
An unintentional slight.

728
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,943
Talk's cheap. Wanna hear it now?

729
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,824
- Right here without your band?
- I'll fake it for you.

730
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,701
I've got to rescue my friend
from boom boom.

731
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,281
I shall rescue the businessman.

732
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,912
Please finish my present.

733
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,127
Well, it's your birthday.

734
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,775
How about a fast arrangement
of "Greensleeves?"

735
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,209
Just a minute, boom boom.
He's mine.

736
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,212
Oh, come on, Sebastian.

737
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,300
I bet you fit in any place.

738
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,055
- I like your friends.
- They came with the lease.

739
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,980
Did that come
with the lease too?

740
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,185
No. I used to date this welder.

741
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,486
He must have been
an awful driver.

742
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,282
No, I had this other boyfriend
who owns a junkyard.

743
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,030
You got a lot of boyfriends,
haven't you?

744
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,281
Hm. You're my first banker.

745
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,613
Why all this shopping around?

746
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,447
Well, if you don't try
everything

747
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,828
how are you gonna find out
what you really like?

748
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,128
Out of the mouths of babes.

749
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,682
Again?

750
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,277
Where did everybody go?

751
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,658
They're all here.

752
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,924
Three weeks later,
we got married.

753
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,474
All in a rush.
Like if we didn't, we'd die.

754
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,643
And if your husband
was still the same

755
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,846
romantic Greenwich village James,

756
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,805
would you be stealing now?

757
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,391
Oh, James hasn't got time
for romance.

758
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,522
He's too busy banking.

759
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,898
So you steal?

760
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,114
You're much too calm about it.

761
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,816
Well, why shouldn't I be calm?

762
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,402
After all, there's nothing
to connect me with the robbery.

763
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,906
Except the yellow suit.

764
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,413
You realize the police
are combing the city for it.

765
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,664
Mm, so I've read.

766
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,462
I took care of it.

767
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,584
You burned it?

768
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,041
No, I gave it away
to a thrift shop.

769
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,421
Thrift shop?

770
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,032
Do you realize
the chance you're taking?

771
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,842
I don't know.

772
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,672
Maybe I'll go buy it back.

773
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,850
Buy it? No, no!

774
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,142
Penny, look.

775
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,185
Are you trying
to get caught, mm?

776
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,168
You never should have gone there
in the first place.

777
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,478
Well, what else could I do?
Throw it away?

778
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,230
It would have been a lot safer.

779
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,358
Gregory, it was a Givenchy suit.

780
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,780
So?

781
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,324
Well, you can't just throw
a Givenchy down a manhole.

782
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,696
It's sacrilege.

783
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,700
And besides, James paid $1100
for that suit

784
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,453
and I wouldn't like
to see him waste his money.

785
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,143
Hi. Lieutenant Bixbee.
Sergeant Rothschild.

786
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,644
What a nice surprise.

787
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,568
Mrs. Elcott, do you shop here?

788
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,897
Yes, I often drop by.
They have fascinating things.

789
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,824
They did yesterday.
They had the yellow suit.

790
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,902
Not really.

791
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:36,996
How did they get it?

792
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,183
Well, they got it the same way

793
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,619
that major Higgins
got his $1000 bill.

794
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,701
It was donated by a blond girl
with a phony French accent.

795
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,003
- And we traced it here.
- Well, how clever of you.

796
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,317
Well, not so clever.

797
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,003
The lady back there read about it
in the paper and called us.

798
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,005
But we were clever enough
to pick up the phone.

799
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,339
Well, that's that.
You've got it.

800
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,925
Not yet. Somebody bought it.
Paid seven bucks.

801
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,136
- Seven bucks? But that...
- What? Too cheap?

802
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,267
Well, that's hard to say.

803
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,723
I'd have to see it first.

804
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,712
Well, why don't you come along
while we pick it up?

805
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,146
Do I get to ride
in a police car?

806
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,900
Yeah, with a siren
and everything.

807
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,705
Does sergeant Rothschild
always drive like that?

808
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,999
He was just showin' off a little.

809
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,912
This is the first police raid
I've ever been invited to.

810
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,713
Are you gonna break down
the door?

811
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,257
Well, you see,
that went out with prohibition.

812
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,255
Now we have a whole new image.

813
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,678
It's very suave and very couth.

814
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,557
So when we get inside,
you just take your cue from me.

815
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,644
Right, chief.

816
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,390
That's lieutenant, Mrs. Elcott.

817
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,937
That's Penelope, lieutenant.

818
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,733
Horatio. My father read a lot.

819
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,316
Mm. Mm.

820
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,695
Mm. Mm.

821
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,124
Oh, cherie.

822
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,579
Now that's what I call
a vintage pastrami.

823
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,413
Mm-hm. Mm.

824
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,509
Mm.

825
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,709
Delish dill pickle...

826
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,679
Is nothing to throw rocks at.

827
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,721
I feel a slight heartburn
building up.

828
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,851
Quickly, my angel,
the cream soda.

829
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,413
Ah, good afternoon,
lady and gentleman.

830
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,836
Welcome to the salon
of Princess Sadaba.

831
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,289
The boutique très chic.

832
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,677
- Salut.
- Ah, this domestic champagne.

833
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,803
Ah, and what can
Princess Sadaba do for you?

834
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,680
Don't tell me, I know.

835
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,979
With such a lovely figure,
you have obviously

836
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,809
come for one of Sadaba's
divine evening gowns.

837
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,895
Oh, no, a suit. Or a suit.

838
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,527
You see how Sadaba knows.

839
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,359
I'd like something bright.
I'm going to Portofino.

840
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,661
Portofino! Oh, it is like fate.

841
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,115
Quick, the number
we have been saving for her.

842
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,828
- Madame Sadaba is psychic.
- Really?

843
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,585
Three weeks ago, she sends
all the way to Paris for this suit.

844
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:39,794
Why? Because she knows you will
be needing it for p-Puerto Rico.

845
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,759
Ducky, darling,
bring out the you-know-what.

846
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,640
Right away, majesty.

847
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,768
Et voilà

848
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,103
here we are.

849
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,984
Hot off the plane from Paris.

850
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,361
I believe you. It's still warm.

851
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,943
Try it on.

852
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,237
- Why?
- Why not?

853
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,243
You'd look good in yellow.

854
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,876
Sadaba is not only psychic,
she's a genius.

855
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,051
Look, see how it fits.
Like it was made for her.

856
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,503
That's just what I was thinking.

857
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,964
So was I.
It's absolutely divine.

858
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,765
It's just you.

859
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,468
Yeah. Yeah, it's just you.

860
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,430
Thank you. I'd love to have it.

861
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:37,689
On second thought, maybe Sadaba
keeps this creation for herself.

862
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,896
- Oh.
- Oh, please take it off.

863
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,402
Sadaba cannot bear
to part with it.

864
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,336
How much?

865
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,130
Oh, for you, Sadaba lets it go
for practically nothing.

866
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,297
Six hundred dollars.

867
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,093
I'll say this for you, Princess,
you got a lot of guts.

868
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,637
Is that the way
to talk to royalty?

869
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,967
Ducky, darling,
go upstairs and get the box.

870
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,399
Ducky will kill me,
but to make your little wife happy,

871
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,853
the Givenchy is yours for 595.

872
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,939
The lady is not my wife.

873
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,742
Sadaba will never
breathe a word.

874
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:29,195
Sadaba can breathe
all she wants.

875
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:33,032
I'm lieutenant Bixbee,
New York police.

876
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,040
Ducky?

877
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,885
The cops.

878
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,514
Uh, we didn't do
nothing illegal.

879
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,435
There's no law
against overcharge.

880
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,854
Just relax, your majesty.

881
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,227
Nobody is accusing anybody
of anything.

882
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,604
The suit is evidence
in a bank robbery.

883
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,152
It was in all the papers.

884
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,232
It was no mention of it in
the Christian science monitor.

885
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,780
Here it is.

886
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:09,986
It'll look lovely on you.

887
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,412
No, Mrs. Elcott,
we're taking it.

888
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,036
- Oh?
- Wrap it up, Princess.

889
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,243
Here. Big spender.

890
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,703
Seven bucks down the drain.

891
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,255
Relax.
Compliments of Merrill lynch.

892
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,425
A whole $3 profit.

893
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,003
I'm terribly sorry.
You do have a lovely shop.

894
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,784
I'd like to come back
when I have more time.

895
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,424
Um, pleasure, pleasure.

896
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,143
Bye.

897
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,612
That name, that face.

898
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,191
I have seen her before, but where?

899
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,776
Where? Where?

900
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:57,329
Ducky, precious, I think
we go immediately browsing

901
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,035
through the back issues of vogue

902
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,121
at the public library. Come on.

903
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,088
The dame's got a lot of nerve
charging those figures, right?

904
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,137
Well, actually,
$600 isn't too far out of line.

905
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,635
For a secondhand suit?

906
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,308
A secondhand Givenchy suit.

907
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,102
I don't recall Sadaba
mentioning a Givenchy suit.

908
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,806
At least not while
you were there.

909
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,687
She didn't? -No!

910
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,144
Well, then how did I know?

911
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,946
Oh, she did say Paris.

912
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,819
I must have put
two and two together.

913
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,443
Yeah.

914
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,403
Yeah, that's probably it.

915
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,837
Very nice.

916
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,927
You know, I was saying
that in my line of work

917
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,472
you don't get a chance to spend
much time in a joint like this.

918
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,996
You know,
I think this is probably

919
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,432
my most favorite place
in New York.

920
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,810
Better than your husband's bank,
Mrs. Elcott?

921
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,777
How did I get demoted from
Penelope back to Mrs. Elcott?

922
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:09,772
Alright. Penelope.

923
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,070
Penelope, do you know...

924
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,365
Most of the time I like my job?

925
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,451
- What's that?
- That? It's bubblegum.

926
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,628
- May I have some?
- Yeah, help yourself.

927
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,091
Who's Ron Swoboda?

928
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,800
I just chew the gum.

929
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,600
You know, it's a funny thing
about crime.

930
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,847
But it's the innocent suspect

931
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,808
that usually looks
the most guilty.

932
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,293
That's because
he's got nothing to hide.

933
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,228
Keeps his guard down.

934
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,005
But the guilty ones,
they're always thinking.

935
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,894
They're watching themselves
pretty good.

936
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,651
How will they sound
and how will that look?

937
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,734
And in the end, it's their very
smoothness that traps them.

938
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,943
It's fascinating.

939
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,824
How do you do that?

940
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,875
Now what kind of a childhood
did you have?

941
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,668
The kind with braces
on your teeth.

942
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,748
Spread the gum flat,
poke your tongue into it

943
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,924
and fill the pocket with air.

944
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,715
- I did it!
- Beginner's luck.

945
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,388
Penelope, I am the best damn cop
I know...

946
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,598
And that's my trouble.

947
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,939
I'm too damn good
for my own damn good.

948
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,855
I think you're very good.

949
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,484
That's what that lady bank robber's
about to find out.

950
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,485
You know, that poor kid
doesn't have a chance.

951
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,286
Mm. -overconfident.

952
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,935
You see, in the neighborhood
that I come from

953
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,870
a kid had three chances.

954
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,313
He could be a hood,
he could be a cop,

955
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,328
he could be a priest.

956
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,585
Well, I was too clumsy to steal
and we weren't catholic.

957
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,963
Maybe if I'd had a neighborhood.

958
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,887
Penelope. What?

959
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,886
Did you spend a lot of time
in your husband's bank?

960
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,684
No, I hardly ever go there
if I can help it. Why?

961
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,886
When we ran the film

962
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,347
you knew the teller's name
just like that.

963
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,897
Well, of course I knew her name.

964
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,067
It was on a plaque
on the counter.

965
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,393
Didn't you see it?

966
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,149
Well, I guess
I'm not as good at my job

967
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,151
as I thought I was. I missed it.

968
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,903
Oh.

969
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,325
Oh, dear.

970
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,572
What's the matter?

971
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,949
I was supposed to meet James
ten minutes ago.

972
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,449
Do I get to keep Ron Swoboda?

973
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,163
Hey, Horatio, watch.

974
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,009
Not bad, hm?

975
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,420
Terrific.

976
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:43,926
Then James began to get promoted
at the bank.

977
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:48,105
Third vice president,
second vice president,

978
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,601
first vice president.

979
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,651
At last, we're getting
to the crux of your problem!

980
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,694
Don't you see it?

981
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,113
You feel left
out of your husband's life

982
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,533
so you compensate
for his lack of attention.

983
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:02,953
I do?

984
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,245
In desperation,
I began taking up hobbies.

985
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,916
First, hobbies with James.

986
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,244
James! James!

987
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,374
Things were still
pretty much up in the air.

988
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,673
So I next tried hobbies
for James.

989
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,344
James! James! Look what we won!

990
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,342
Good girl.

991
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,173
Good boy.

992
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,554
Well, at least
he patted me first.

993
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,974
Nothing worked.

994
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,555
It's funny.

995
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,484
There's only one hobby
that seemed to cheer me up.

996
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,571
Burglary.

997
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,021
Not burglary.
That's forcible entry.

998
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,027
All you committed
was simple larceny.

999
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,985
Please, Gregory, I'd rather
think of it as burglary.

1000
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,911
It's more exciting.

1001
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,661
Penelope, how many victims
did you burglarize?

1002
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,208
And whom did you choose
to burgle?

1003
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,162
Uh, bur-burglarize. Uh, Rob.

1004
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,588
I don't know. Just people.

1005
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,007
Yes, people.
People who are your husband's

1006
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,426
business associates, huh?

1007
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,719
Yes.

1008
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:04,594
For some reason,
I just hated them.

1009
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,964
No matter where James and I went

1010
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,135
there was no getting away
from the world of finance.

1011
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,874
"The president's statement on taxes

1012
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,854
brought selling pressure
into the market.

1013
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,382
And though
he did reiterate that...

1014
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,479
Oh, let's go for a little swim.

1015
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,811
Eh, well... don't you think
it's late, isn't it?

1016
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,442
Oh, come on.

1017
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,819
At Newport,
it was Johanna Keller,

1018
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,491
one of the bank's
biggest depositors.

1019
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,239
- The last hot dog I ate...
- Oh, come on.

1020
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,911
Oh, please, miss...

1021
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,807
After that, we didn't see
so much of miss Keller.

1022
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,735
Even when we'd go dancing,
like the night at the block,

1023
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,528
sooner or later,
James' banking friends

1024
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,822
would manage to spoil our fun.

1025
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,868
Oh, sooner or later, I'm going to
have to talk business with them.

1026
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,161
I don't see why.

1027
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,705
After all, you don't dance
with them at the bank, do you?

1028
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,579
I love you, darling.

1029
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,252
I'm glad I don't have to do
business with you.

1030
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,876
Not fair, you two.

1031
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,878
Oh, it's "la Bostella."

1032
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,880
Couldn't you just die?

1033
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,553
When the music stops,
we all fall down.

1034
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,983
I just had to fix him.

1035
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,614
Not bad.

1036
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,416
Diamond tiara, three brooches,

1037
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,836
nine bracelets and a lavaliere.

1038
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,006
Oh, and my best caper
was when I took...

1039
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,216
Penny, just stop. Just stop.

1040
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,794
But there's lots more.
I could go on for hours.

1041
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,175
Maybe you could, but I couldn't.

1042
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,099
Gregory, you mustn't let this
depress you.

1043
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,643
Depression is a luxury

1044
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,187
not permitted
the experienced psychiatrist.

1045
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,559
Well, that's good.

1046
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,651
Because there is a bright side
to this whole thing.

1047
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,274
Well, the way
my marriage was headed

1048
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,856
and the state of nerves I was in,

1049
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,657
if it hadn't been
for kleptomania

1050
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,655
I might have gone a little kook.

1051
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,873
Penny, do you have any idea
how difficult

1052
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,496
it is being your analyst?

1053
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,372
Oh, Gregory,
you should have known me

1054
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,999
in the days before you knew me.

1055
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,331
I was vague, frivolous.

1056
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,381
You might even say
a bit of a ding.

1057
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,960
Thank heaven,
I've settled down. Bye.

1058
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,598
What do you suppose it means

1059
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,898
when you keep forgetting
your shoes? Hm.

1060
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,963
Where are you rushing to?
You still have seven minutes left.

1061
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,444
Oh, you can owe me.
I'm off to the park Lane galleries.

1062
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,613
There's a Rembrandt there
that's a steal.

1063
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,032
A Rembrandt.
Penny, you wouldn't.

1064
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,157
Taxi! Taxi!

1065
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,192
Psst.

1066
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,948
Psst.

1067
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,039
Gregory. Shh!

1068
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,408
What? Police.

1069
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,700
They may have followed me.
Police?

1070
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,832
Gregory, what have you done?

1071
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,788
Nothing.
I haven't done anything.

1072
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:07,987
Well,
if you haven't done anything

1073
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,071
then why would the police...

1074
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:13,259
Penelope, I don't want to get
into a discussion, not now.

1075
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,683
Now tell me, where,
where did you hide the money?

1076
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,770
What money?

1077
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,765
What do you mean, what money?
You know what...

1078
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,022
Loot. The loot.

1079
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,940
Oh, that money.

1080
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,737
Well, frankly,
that's had me very worried.

1081
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,360
I mean, I couldn't just leave it
lying around any place.

1082
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,284
You know,
that could be very dodgy.

1083
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,282
I carry it with... oh!

1084
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,377
Your lieutenant Bixbee,
he knows.

1085
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,583
He just came to see me.

1086
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,293
I thought he acted
strangely yesterday.

1087
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,925
Strangely how?

1088
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,678
I don't know. Sort of... guilty.

1089
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,135
Why would he feel guilty?
Oh, never mind. Ooh!

1090
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:05,859
Penny, listen to me.

1091
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,671
You've got to get that money
back to the bank today.

1092
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,560
Now. How?

1093
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,271
I can't just walk in
and hand it over.

1094
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,776
Well, I figured that...

1095
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,982
Oh, give me the money

1096
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,284
and I'll, I'll stick it
in the night deposit chute.

1097
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,113
Oh, Gregory, I don't like
to see you get involved.

1098
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,868
Neither do I.

1099
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,870
Come on. All of it.

1100
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,171
Oh, penny.

1101
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,765
Penny.

1102
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,472
- Alright, how do I look?
- Frightened.

1103
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,808
Oh, no, I mean up here.

1104
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,733
- Like Batman.
- Thanks.

1105
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,812
Gregory, you're very sweet.

1106
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,942
But why do you insist
on doing this?

1107
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,819
Because I'm in love with you.

1108
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,696
- Because I'm crazy about you.
- Gregory.

1109
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,529
And when I say crazy,
I'm using the word medically.

1110
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,143
- But just the other day...
- Forget it.

1111
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,624
- You said...
- Forget it. Forget it!

1112
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:09,421
Now let's get out of here
and try to act very natural.

1113
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,601
- They locked us in!
- Don't worry.

1114
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:28,919
That bell
ought to bring somebody.

1115
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,855
That bell will bring everybody.
That's a burglar alarm.

1116
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,857
- What if they search us?
- Well, what of it?

1117
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,010
- We haven't stolen anything.
- Not today, we haven't.

1118
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,194
What do you think this is?

1119
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,742
- Oh, penny.
- They wouldn't dare search us.

1120
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,741
Yoo-hoo, somebody! Yoo-hoo!

1121
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,322
Not yet! Not yet!

1122
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,282
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

1123
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,083
Good evening. Would you mind
opening the gate, please?

1124
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,335
You in there,
what are you up to?

1125
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,962
Nothing. I swear it.

1126
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,964
Please call the manager.

1127
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,384
I am the manager.

1128
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,841
Where were you hiding
when we locked up?

1129
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,722
Oh, right behind that cabinet.

1130
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:05,956
No, we weren't.
We weren't hiding.

1131
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,345
We were standing.
We were standing.

1132
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,726
Don't you realize we're closed?

1133
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,227
Well, that's just the trouble.

1134
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,901
If you were open,
we could leave.

1135
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,149
And don't you dare try
to search us

1136
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,526
or we'll call the police.

1137
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,824
Penelope! She didn't mean that.

1138
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,822
You didn't mean that.

1139
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,282
What are you, lady?
Some kind of a nut?

1140
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,492
I don't care for your attitude.

1141
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,980
And for your information,
you have seen

1142
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,416
the last of me in this gallery.

1143
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,997
Come, Gregory.

1144
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,074
Morning, darling. Hello. Yeah.

1145
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,367
Yeah.

1146
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:46,903
Yes.

1147
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,489
What? You sure?

1148
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,540
Yeah, I-l find that hard
to believe.

1149
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,502
In, uh, half an hour.

1150
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,625
Right.

1151
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,628
Who was that on the phone?

1152
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,300
The bank.

1153
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,254
Oh, what'd they want?

1154
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,089
What did who want?

1155
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,515
The bank.

1156
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,342
They wanted to talk to me.

1157
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,553
- Well, what about?
- About banking.

1158
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:13,982
Oh.

1159
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,865
Well, where did they hide
the financial section?

1160
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,693
Since when have you been
concerned with money matters?

1161
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:29,029
I'm just showing
a little wifely interest.

1162
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,913
Well, that's funny.
The financial section?

1163
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,798
No, I was just hoping...

1164
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,216
- Morning, Toshi.
- Morning.

1165
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,759
I just thought maybe
there might be

1166
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,115
some good news
about the robbery.

1167
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,004
How can there be good news
about bad news?

1168
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,558
Well, it's possible.
You could get the money back.

1169
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,306
That wouldn't be
in the financial section.

1170
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,888
It would be on the religious page
under miracles.

1171
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,564
Well, you already got
that $1000 back.

1172
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,296
Let's hope I don't get the rest
back the same way.

1173
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,436
I could go broke.

1174
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:04,568
James, you still don't understand
about that, do you...

1175
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:05,899
Now I do, I do, I do.

1176
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,304
Now, please,
don't explain it again.

1177
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,865
I broke even, I'm delighted,
I'm delirious, huh?

1178
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,995
Well, you did break even. Mm.

1179
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,372
Dr. Mannix says
you're just being stubborn.

1180
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,048
Oh, Dr. Mannix says that,
does he?

1181
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,296
Yes, he does.

1182
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:27,003
How does Dr. Mannix
know anything about it?

1183
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,804
Well, I told him.

1184
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,350
I tell him everything.

1185
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,143
What do you mean, everything?

1186
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,513
Everything.

1187
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,268
About me too?

1188
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,020
Well, of course.

1189
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,648
I think I'll have a talk
with your Dr. Mannix.

1190
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,355
James, that's marvelous.

1191
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,657
You have no idea
how much he could help you.

1192
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,450
I don't want help.

1193
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,073
Well, then why waste the money?

1194
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,075
Lieutenant Bixbee.

1195
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,955
Your money...

1196
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,161
We got it all back.

1197
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,256
I knew it.

1198
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,046
Seems I underestimated you,
Bixbee.

1199
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:05,112
I thought maybe you'd like
to go down to headquarters.

1200
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,469
You see, we also got the girl
who stole it.

1201
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,547
We're bringing her up
for questioning now.

1202
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,682
Toshi, my hat!

1203
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,259
I don't understand.

1204
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,140
Well, you know, it kind of
took me by surprise too.

1205
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,064
I thought I had this case
all figured out.

1206
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,062
- Goes to show you.
- Ready, lieutenant.

1207
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,060
Wait a minute.
James, I'll go with you.

1208
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,508
No, no, darling, there's no need
for you to be involved in this.

1209
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,488
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1210
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:37,495
Horatio, what if you've
arrested the wrong girl?

1211
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,585
Not a chance.

1212
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,206
She had the money on her
when we picked her up.

1213
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,583
Alright. Right this way.

1214
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,882
Oh, hi, doll.

1215
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,884
Well, you're new in here,
aren't you?

1216
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,787
I mean, I don't recall
making your acquaintance

1217
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,642
in night court or nothin'.

1218
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,972
Mine's honeysuckle Rose.

1219
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,890
You must be doing pretty good.

1220
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,850
That almost looks like
for-real mink.

1221
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,653
Alright, miss Rose.
Just hold it. Relax a minute.

1222
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,571
No offense, Mrs. Elcott.

1223
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,947
The lady in the genuine mink
is the wife of this gentleman,

1224
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,870
who happens to be the president
of the bank that you hit.

1225
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,493
Oh.

1226
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,787
Well, she looks
pretty enough to be...

1227
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,243
What's your right name, honey?

1228
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,750
Well, I told you.
Honeysuckle Rose.

1229
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,832
My sister's Mexicali Rose.

1230
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,793
I know, the roses
of Washington square.

1231
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,468
Huntington, West Virginia.

1232
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,763
We drove through there once,
James, remember?

1233
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,702
Penelope, please.
Can't we get on with this, hm?

1234
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,637
Honeysuckle, why don't you
be a good girl

1235
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,764
and just give us
a full confession?

1236
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,769
Hm, okay.

1237
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,944
Um, I was walking my cat
up park Avenue

1238
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,986
around, uh, 3 o'clock
this morning

1239
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:54,818
when I see that lying
on the sidewalk... practically.

1240
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,868
Correction.
You walked into my bank

1241
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,141
around 3 o'clock
in the afternoon

1242
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,076
two days ago
and stole the money.

1243
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,953
Now wait a minute.

1244
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,956
Do I look like a person
who'd stick up a bank?

1245
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,207
Of course not.

1246
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,587
Oh, come now, walking a cat
at 3 o'clock in the morning?

1247
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,633
I don't see
anything wrong with that.

1248
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,461
She probably does night work.

1249
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,842
- Do you?
- Well, uh...

1250
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,178
Yeah.

1251
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,055
You see?

1252
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,228
Well, I'm glad
we got that decided.

1253
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:25,807
Penelope, I don't think
you're getting the full picture.

1254
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:29,065
You see, the charge
against miss Rose here

1255
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,272
is not cat-walking,
it's bank-robbing.

1256
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,072
Well, it's a frame.

1257
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,243
I never set foot inside
that bank, I swear it.

1258
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,911
I believe you.

1259
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,410
Well, but they don't.

1260
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,867
Well, look at their faces!

1261
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,294
Oh, this is no 30 days and out rap.

1262
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,214
They-they wanna lock me up
and throw away the key.

1263
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:53,714
Honey, believe me, you're only
making it tough on yourself

1264
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,795
by sticking to this
cockamamie story.

1265
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,256
Well, that's the only
cockamamie story I know!

1266
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,786
Alright, matron,
get her out of here.

1267
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,176
Oh, no. No, wait.

1268
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,478
Wait, I-i-l admit it.

1269
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,726
Lied.

1270
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,274
The-the money w-wasn't
on the sidewalk.

1271
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:12,229
I-it was sticking
out of the deposit slot.

1272
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:16,066
Well, I was gonna return it.
Maybe collect a reward even.

1273
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,071
But that doesn't make me
a bank robber, does it?

1274
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,744
I mean, not-not like they mean.

1275
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,368
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1276
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,324
You're making
a terrible mistake.

1277
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,080
Honey, they know
what they're doing.

1278
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,503
Well, how do you know
that she isn't telling the truth?

1279
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,548
It's my theory. It could have
happened exactly as she said it.

1280
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,672
You mean somebody
actually left $59,000

1281
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,470
on the doorstep of a bank
in the middle of the night?

1282
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,718
- Yes!
- Who, Mrs. Elcott?

1283
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,264
The thief, that's who.
The bank robber.

1284
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,095
For what possible reason,
darling?

1285
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,647
Because she was trying
to get rid of it.

1286
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,443
In the same bank
that she stole it from?

1287
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,191
Certainly.

1288
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:57,023
You see, she never wanted
the money in the first place.

1289
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,860
- She only took it because...
- Because why?

1290
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,529
Because she couldn't
help herself.

1291
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,364
Uh, we appreciate your help,
Mrs. Elcott,

1292
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,451
but your theory is based
on sympathy for the suspect,

1293
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:09,546
not fact.

1294
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,120
Okay, matron.

1295
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,580
No!

1296
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,585
Alright.

1297
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,044
You wanted a confession
and I'll see that you get one.

1298
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,801
Thanks a lot,
but miss Rose is not talking.

1299
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:23,803
No, not from miss Rose,
from the bank robber.

1300
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,680
From the woman
who robbed your bank

1301
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,683
and escaped in a red wig
and a yellow suit.

1302
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,889
Me.

1303
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,650
I'm sorry, James.

1304
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,821
I'll just have to explain later
why it had to be your bank.

1305
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,772
But right now,
the most important thing

1306
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,108
is to get to the truth of this

1307
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,909
so that this poor innocent girl
doesn't have to go to jail.

1308
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,790
So if you will call
a stenographer

1309
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,146
I will dictate a full statement.

1310
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,582
Now, Mrs. Elcott,
I'm afraid you're under a strain.

1311
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,899
Perhaps
you better take her home.

1312
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,629
You know, a nap or somethin'.

1313
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,552
Why, you don't believe me.

1314
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,387
None of you.

1315
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,925
You don't recognize the truth
when it slaps you in the face.

1316
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,263
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

1317
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,848
Oh, no, certainly not. No.

1318
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,150
Uh, you know, sometimes, uh...

1319
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,102
Well, we all need help
sometimes.

1320
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,198
Well, I am not under a strain.

1321
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,116
And as far as my head,
it has never been

1322
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,535
clearer than at this moment.

1323
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,362
And as far as my needing help
is concerned,

1324
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:29,870
let me assure you that I see my
psychiatrist five times a week.

1325
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,876
Matron.

1326
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,125
I'm sorry, miss Rose.

1327
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,878
But don't worry,
they can't keep you long.

1328
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,175
I'll make them believe me.
I promise you.

1329
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,672
Thank you.

1330
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,925
But-but you know something,
Mrs. Elcott,

1331
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,972
a-and it's a shame,

1332
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,513
even I don't believe you.

1333
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,737
My poor darling.

1334
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,441
Oh, I'm so disappointed
in you, James.

1335
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,276
Why won't you believe me?

1336
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,987
Believe you're a kleptomaniac?
A thief? A bank robber?

1337
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,868
Darling, would you
believe that of me?

1338
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:10,959
Of course.

1339
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,749
If you really
and truly wanted me

1340
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,748
to believe that you were a thief,
I would.

1341
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,171
- Because I trust you.
- How can I believe you?

1342
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,318
Last night at 3:00
in the morning

1343
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,923
you were in bed next to me.

1344
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,501
Well, what's wrong with that?
We're married.

1345
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:25,008
Uh, but-but the money, darling.

1346
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,635
Oh, that.

1347
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,932
Gregory took it back for me.

1348
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,351
I must say he didn't do
a very good job of it.

1349
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,999
He's not doing a very good job
of helping you

1350
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,685
by humoring
these fantasies of yours.

1351
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,313
Do you know why Gregory says
I robbed your bank?

1352
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,020
Because you pay more attention
to it than you do to me.

1353
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,322
You hardly ever
even notice me anymore.

1354
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,947
You know I do. What do you want?
Tell me what you want.

1355
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,403
Anything, anything you want,
darling.

1356
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,038
Well, there's only one thing
I really care about.

1357
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:57,787
Something that would mean
a great deal to me.

1358
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:58,962
Name it.

1359
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,710
I'd like to give
a nice cocktail party

1360
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,291
for all of your friends.

1361
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,047
A cocktail party.

1362
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,014
Should you tell the driver
to drop you off at the bank?

1363
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,466
In this?

1364
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,667
She's home? Mrs. Elcott?

1365
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,915
Who is calling, please?

1366
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,879
Friends.

1367
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,340
Anonymous.

1368
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,424
Mr. and Mrs. anonymous.

1369
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:50,715
Hello.

1370
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,176
- You remember Sadaba?
- And ducky?

1371
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:55,727
Of course.

1372
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,099
Have a seat, Mrs. Elcott.

1373
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,610
Is there something
I can do for you?

1374
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:07,155
- For us? No.
- We do something for you.

1375
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,450
Oh, well, I'm expecting guests.

1376
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,447
Uh, if you're here
to sell me a dress...

1377
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,199
Much more important
than a dress.

1378
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,906
We come to sell you freedom.

1379
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,702
Oh! Oh, well,
that's a wonderful cause.

1380
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,583
I'm always interested
in freedom.

1381
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,131
- For everybody.
- Especially for you.

1382
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,714
The check now.

1383
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,220
How much would you like?

1384
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,922
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

1385
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,053
As much as that?

1386
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,181
Well, what, uh, is it for?

1387
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,855
To keep a nice lady out of jail.

1388
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:45,482
Sadaba knows Mrs. James Elcott
robbed her husband's bank.

1389
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,905
You know that?

1390
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:55,078
Really? Are you positive?

1391
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,156
You didn't hear her
just tell you?

1392
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,450
Can you prove it?

1393
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,878
Is Sadaba a fool?

1394
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,456
Certainly she proves it. How?

1395
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:12,180
Here is a picture
from magazine two years old.

1396
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,931
You recognize the lady?

1397
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:17,431
- It's me!
- Oh, not so close.

1398
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:21,184
Ducky, sweetheart,
read the words.

1399
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,312
"At luncheon for charity,
Mrs. James Elcott of New York

1400
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:29,067
wearing a suit of yellow wool
designed by Givenchy."

1401
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,649
It's me in the yellow suit!

1402
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,030
Well, if anybody saw that...

1403
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,664
You're blackmailing me!

1404
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:40,908
Blackmail is a criminal offense.

1405
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,743
What we're trying to do

1406
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,877
is a $25,000 good turn.

1407
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,377
Oh.

1408
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,302
And suppose I won't pay it?

1409
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,131
But you will,
or we show this to your husband.

1410
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,971
Oh, can I depend on that?

1411
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,511
Here is my word.

1412
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,643
What does she mean,
depend on it?

1413
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,942
Oh, he ought to be along
any minute.

1414
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,314
Can you wait?

1415
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:12,648
So maybe the husband
is in the game, huh?

1416
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,906
So maybe we don't even bother
to show him?

1417
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,078
Oh, you've got to, please.

1418
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,406
We don't got...

1419
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,083
But maybe we take the picture
to the police.

1420
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,286
Right away. Quick.

1421
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,372
What do you say to that?

1422
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,297
Okay, I-I'll go with you.

1423
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,591
No.

1424
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:34,340
Ducky, something is smelling
crooked in the place.

1425
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,423
- Out.
- No! Oh, wait! Please, listen!

1426
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,930
- We get rid of the evidence!
- Stop! What are you doing?

1427
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,931
Please,
you're spoiling everything!

1428
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,308
We swallow the evidence!
Swallow!

1429
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,732
James, oh, darling.

1430
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,275
Thank heaven you're here.

1431
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:52,401
Darling, this is
Princess Sadaba and Ducky.

1432
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,699
And they came here
to blackmail me.

1433
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:59,620
Princess Sadaba,
now please explain to my husband

1434
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:02,072
why you're blackmailing me.

1435
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:06,665
We came to interest your wife
in an evening gown.

1436
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,872
Out of the blue,
suddenly I'm hearing

1437
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,548
uh, about blackmail.

1438
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,500
James, that's not true.

1439
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,961
They have positive proof
that I robbed your bank.

1440
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,056
What bank?

1441
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,972
Mr. Elcott, I hate to say this,

1442
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,641
but you are married
to some wacky woman.

1443
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:24,344
My wife has not been
feeling too well lately.

1444
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,058
James, are you going
to believe them or me?

1445
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,983
Honey,
you're imagining things again.

1446
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,312
Imagining things?
Imagining things?

1447
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,114
Alright, ask him
what he's eating.

1448
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,986
Excuse me, sir,
what are you eating?

1449
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:44,073
- I had a late lunch.
- Thank you.

1450
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,076
Oh!

1451
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,126
Come, highness.

1452
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,592
I'm sorry.

1453
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,761
If there's any way
I can make amends...

1454
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,010
You got maybe a little seltzer?

1455
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,557
Out!

1456
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,528
James, such a fun party.

1457
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,606
When's your Penelope
going to appear?

1458
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,900
Maybe she's having zipper trouble.
I'll just go and see.

1459
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,032
Dr. Mannix.

1460
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,787
I didn't know a psychiatrist
made house calls.

1461
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,493
I am a guest.

1462
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,749
And I have an invitation. See?

1463
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,751
You did. Now you don't.

1464
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,837
Isn't that a rather
childish thing to do?

1465
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,543
Then how about something
more grownup?

1466
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,299
Say, a punch in the nose?

1467
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:42,256
Taking out your aggressions on me
is not going to help you.

1468
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,511
It won't help you, but then
you're not helping my wife.

1469
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,893
I've only been on the case
for three years, sir.

1470
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,392
At the end of which time,
your patient, your former patient

1471
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,127
is worse off than
when she first started with you.

1472
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,688
Former? W-w-what do you mean by,
uh, former? I don't understand.

1473
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,269
Then I'll explain. You're fired.

1474
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,730
Wait! Elcott, you can't do that!

1475
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,535
Penny. Penny?

1476
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,287
Yes, what is it?

1477
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,039
Everyone's asking for you, honey.
Are you coming out?

1478
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,166
I told you, yes.

1479
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:15,464
When?

1480
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,334
As soon as Mildred Halliday
gets here.

1481
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,715
What's Mildred Halliday
got to do with it?

1482
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,140
You'll see.

1483
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:29,929
Penny, just let me in
and we'll talk it over, huh?

1484
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,227
Penny, if you'll just answer me.

1485
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,933
Penny, open!

1486
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,319
This knob, it sticks. Oh.

1487
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,842
- I have to get a screwdriver.
- Mm-hmm.

1488
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:42,448
Well, you should try to find it
in the yellow pages.

1489
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:44,447
Or open my door.

1490
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,951
Hello, Mildred.
Welcome to the party.

1491
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:57,756
Oh, James, make sure Mildred
gets everything she wants.

1492
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:03,386
- Oh, poor darling.
- Oh, Mildred.

1493
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:04,883
Would you mind doing me a favor?

1494
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,761
Oh, anything, anything.

1495
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,888
Try kissing somebody else
for a change, huh?

1496
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,014
Well, honestly, I do,

1497
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,892
but I just don't
enjoy it as much.

1498
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:24,446
A double scotch.
Soda or over the rocks?

1499
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,868
Over another double scotch.

1500
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,866
Ooh, yummy, I'll drink to that.

1501
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:48,848
Good evening. Good evening.

1502
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,309
Good evening, James.

1503
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,012
Penny, what's all this?
You'll see.

1504
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:01,565
Dear miss Heller,
so good of you to come.

1505
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,740
Have you seen the bottom of any
good swimming pools lately?

1506
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,822
Mistaken? I...

1507
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,296
Daphne. Daphne, darling.

1508
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:22,625
The next time you go discothequeing,
you should be more careful.

1509
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,380
You lost your tiara.

1510
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,837
James, is this her idea
of a joke?

1511
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,674
Penny darling, come inside.

1512
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,016
Mildred, for some reason

1513
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,143
they don't seem
to want their jewelry back.

1514
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,815
But I'm sure you will.

1515
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:41,063
A memento of my wedding day.

1516
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,988
Dear Penelope, you always did

1517
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:47,282
have such a quaint
sense of humor.

1518
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,576
I never saw those emeralds
in my life.

1519
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,208
- Mildred!
- Penny, please.

1520
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,411
James, something's wrong.

1521
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,462
Something's terribly wrong.

1522
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,211
I'm frightened.

1523
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:04,666
Penelope, wait!

1524
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:10,342
- Penelope! Penelope, wait!
- Jimmy, let her go.

1525
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,328
She knows she's made a fool
of herself and she's embarrassed.

1526
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,638
- I've got to stop her.
- Oh, you'll be sorry if you do.

1527
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,140
I'll be sorry if I don't.

1528
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,236
All night long.

1529
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:09,065
I tell you
I'm frantic with worry.

1530
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,365
If you think of anything...

1531
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,443
Well, it's obvious
she thinks you've failed her.

1532
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,743
She's confused.

1533
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,070
And in her confusion

1534
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,622
she'll turn to the one person
she can trust.

1535
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,825
Yours truly.
Just calm down, Elcott.

1536
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,626
We're doing everything we can.

1537
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,078
If your wife feels
in any danger,

1538
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:26,085
no offense, it's me that
she'll come to for protection.

1539
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,476
Miss Serena.

1540
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,812
- Oh, what a sweet name.
- Thank you.

1541
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:51,023
I always think that names
have a great influence...

1542
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,631
Who do you think... ow!

1543
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,799
Alright, let me... watch out.

1544
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:13,045
I'm not afraid of you,
you big bully.

1545
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:16,131
The idea of an old woman
taking a...

1546
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,349
Shame on you!

1547
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,570
Shatterproof, ha!

1548
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,077
Shut that damn thing off!

1549
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,532
Thank you.

1550
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:53,298
Oh, my fertile eggs
and my yogurt. I'll sue you.

1551
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:57,347
Now let's see who's under
this ridiculous-looking mask.

1552
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,136
She didn't say nothin'
about nose-tweaking

1553
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,686
when she give me the ten bucks.

1554
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:05,604
She? Who?

1555
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:08,980
A practical joke, she said,
and I believed her.

1556
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,187
Her with those big,
sad brown eyes,

1557
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,819
and how she could cry.

1558
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,985
What did she look like?

1559
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,915
Young, pretty,
white evening gown

1560
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,960
and about so big.

1561
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,713
Penelope.

1562
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:38,422
- Oh!
- Darling, it's me.

1563
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,057
It isn't you.

1564
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:44,227
We've been robbed. Back there
while we were all up here.

1565
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,771
Penelope.

1566
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,906
Elcott, wait a minute.

1567
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,654
I know. Follow the cab.

1568
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,485
No, no, I'm looking for a girl.

1569
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,820
Who ain't?

1570
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,076
And she'd have just
come out of the bank.

1571
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,249
- With a real nice wiggle?
- Yes, yes.

1572
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:07,826
Which, which-which way
did she go?

1573
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,411
Downtown.

1574
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,834
Downtown?

1575
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,754
What you starin' at, Mac?

1576
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,386
That face.

1577
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,098
Oh, for-for a moment,
you looked just like my wife.

1578
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,601
And I thought mine was a dog.

1579
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,028
Downtown, you said?

1580
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,982
Uh, take me to centre street,
police headquarters.

1581
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:43,198
Penelope?

1582
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,490
I was right. You came to me.

1583
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,824
Who else would I come to?

1584
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,063
You want me to go ahead
without you?

1585
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,668
Listen,
you're not gonna believe this,

1586
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,041
but somebody just knocked over
your husband's bank.

1587
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,920
Well, you won't believe this,
but I believe you.

1588
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,718
You robbed your husband's bank?

1589
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:00,921
Twice.

1590
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:09,813
Sergeant, I just solved
the Elcott case.

1591
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:13,775
When I grow up,
I wanna be a cop just like you.

1592
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,465
You'll have to release
honeysuckle now, won't you?

1593
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,150
Scout's honor.

1594
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,824
I'm going, I'm going.

1595
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:29,117
Well, I, uh, I guess we won't
be seeing one another anymore.

1596
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,620
Aren't you gonna arrest me?

1597
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,828
Not unless the bank president
presses charges,

1598
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:34,537
which is hardly likely.

1599
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:37,712
Thank you, Horatio.

1600
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,301
You're welcome, Penelope.

1601
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,845
Well, it was a great criminal career
while it lasted.

1602
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,563
One of the best.

1603
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,633
Mr. Elcott, come on in.

1604
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:28,933
I've never seen you
take a drink before 5:00.

1605
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,219
It's gotta be 5:00 someplace.

1606
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,348
But you're not Penelope.

1607
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,604
Hear that?

1608
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,311
And this guy sends his wife
to the crazy doctor.

1609
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,162
I don't think
whisky's your answer.

1610
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,203
Gregory.

1611
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,294
Gregory?

1612
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,960
I told him you would turn to me.

1613
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,164
Oh, who else could I turn to?

1614
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,920
Thank heaven
you're safe and sound.

1615
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,750
Safe but not sound.

1616
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:05,303
Gregory, I'm really frightened.

1617
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,722
There must be something
terribly wrong with me.

1618
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,925
I mean, I just cannot
get it through my head

1619
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,556
that I didn't actually
steal all those jewels.

1620
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,353
And yet I know I couldn't have.

1621
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,101
You did steal the jewels.

1622
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,005
They stuck
the insurance companies

1623
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,394
with their claims but good,

1624
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,855
so naturally, they didn't
want the stuff back.

1625
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,621
Then I'm completely cured.

1626
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,078
You are?

1627
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,035
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

1628
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,247
I just finished
robbing James' bank again.

1629
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,502
But you're completely cured?

1630
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:43,959
Of course.

1631
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:45,759
Because the whole time
I was doing it

1632
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,428
I was crying like anything.

1633
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:48,721
Don't you get it?

1634
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,390
You see, the stealing didn't
make me cheerful anymore.

1635
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:52,717
It made me feel rotten.

1636
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,178
So that means
I'm not a kleptomaniac.

1637
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:56,729
Isn't that wonderful?

1638
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,315
That's terrible.

1639
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:02,314
No more stealing.
No more hobbies.

1640
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:04,191
No more marriage.

1641
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:06,147
Just feeling rotten.

1642
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:07,948
Is that wonderful?

1643
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,656
What next?

1644
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:12,703
Well, you could marry me.

1645
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,530
I know it sounds unethical,

1646
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:15,991
and you'd probably
have difficulty

1647
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,076
readjusting me
from a father figure

1648
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:19,627
to a lover image.

1649
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:22,539
And I'm probably
too tall for you.

1650
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,170
Too old.

1651
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,000
I'm sure you don't have
enough closet space

1652
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:27,960
for my clothes
in your apartment.

1653
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,254
I do snore a lot and...

1654
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:34,058
I have this ulcer.

1655
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,597
Dr. Knoblock!

1656
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,855
I need help!

1657
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:46,052
How could you do this to me,
Penelope?

1658
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:49,107
You know
I can't stand rejection.

1659
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,620
Penelope.

1660
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:01,874
Dr. Mannix.

1661
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:05,878
Uh, you, you've got to help me.

1662
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:09,382
Everywhere I look,
all I can see is Penelope.

1663
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,179
In the bank, in the cab,
at the police station.

1664
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,387
And just now when I came in,

1665
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,637
even you looked
like Penelope to me.

1666
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:18,060
I know it's all mixed up
with loving her and missing her

1667
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:20,058
and, and feeling guilty

1668
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:23,186
about shoving her aside
for that stupid bank.

1669
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,898
I probably shouldn't be
boring you with all this.

1670
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,355
Oh, no, don't stop now.

1671
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:30,405
You're just getting
to the good part.

1672
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,905
Ah, now I'm really gone.

1673
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:34,987
You even sound like her.

1674
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:38,244
If there was only some way,
if I could only find her

1675
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,825
and tell her
how much I need her.

1676
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,343
Dr. Mannix, you need help.

1677
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:52,825
Everybody does these days.

1678
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,326
The only difference is,
we well-adjusted

1679
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,591
maladjusted ones
realize it in time.

1680
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,474
And besides,
the best help of all

1681
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,476
is the kind
you can only get at home.

1682
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:16,698
What does it mean
when you forget your shoes?

1683
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,326
- Well...
- It means we're cured, darling.
