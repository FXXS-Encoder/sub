金庫確實從堅硬的花崗岩中被炸出
The vaults literally blasted out of the solid granite

26
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,774
曼哈頓島的花崗岩。
of Manhattan island.

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,739
是的，先生們，
就像我那位蘇格蘭老祖父
Yes, gentlemen, as my old Scottish grandfather

28
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,863
可能會說，
“把你的錢放在我們這裏
might have said, "your money is safer with us

29
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,821
比交給尼斯湖水怪本人守護還要安全。”
than if it were guarded by the loch Ness monster herself."

30
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,246
現在，請隨我進行政套間。
And now if you will follow me into the executive suite.

31
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,089
哦，希望您不介意。
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

32
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,094
哦，塞雷娜小姐。
真是個好聽的名字。
Oh, miss Serena. What a sweet name.

33
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,549
謝謝。
Thank you.

34
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,304
我認爲名字對性格有很大影響。
I think names have a great influence on character.

35
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,306
- 難道不是嗎？- 嗯，怎麼說？
- Don"t you? - Well, how's that?

36
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,857
名叫塞雷娜的小姐應該沉着而寧靜。
A lady named miss Serena ought to be calm and serene.

37
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,309
- 你是嗎？ - 我盡力而爲。
- Are you? - Well, I try to be.

38
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,316
那就好，
因爲這是搶劫。
That's good, because this is a stickup.

39
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,147
現在，呃，別動。
Now, ah, don't move.

40
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,198
別把腳放到那個警報按鈕上
And don't put your foot on that alarm button

41
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,241
否則我就不得不開槍。
or I shall be forced to blast you.

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,868
親愛的，把那些好看的新的500美元鈔票捆給我。
Dearie, hand me those nice new stacks of $500 bills.

43
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,827
更多。
More.

44
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,873
哦。
Ooh.

45
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,552
那些印着格羅弗·克利夫蘭頭像的鈔票是什麼？1000美元嗎？
What are those bills with dear grover Cleveland's picture

46
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,300
也給我一把那種。
on them? $1000 bills?

47
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,508
讓我也來一把那種。
Let me have a handful of those too.

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,731
哦，還有一件事。
Oh, one more thing.

49
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,151
女士洗手間怎麼走？
Which way is the ladies' room?

50
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,112
謝謝你，親愛的。
你幫了大忙。
Thank you, dearie. You've been very helpful.

51
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,095
啦啦啦！
Ra-ra-ra!

52
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,549
爲啥要三呼？不！
Three cheers for what? =no!

53
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,759
搶了！
R-robbed!

54
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,765
被搶了？有人快去叫 Elcott 先生。
Robbed? Someone call Mr. Elcott.

55
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,187
是誰幹的？指出來。
Who did it? Point him out.

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,015
大家往後退。
Stand back, everybody.

57
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,841
不是他。是位女士。
Not him. Lady.

58
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,844
- 老年女士。 - 你能描述她嗎？
- Old lady. - Can you describe her?

59
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,472
- 老，老... - 冷靜點，冷靜！
- Old, old... - Calm down, calm down!

60
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,928
放輕鬆。 - 老...
Relax. -Old...

61
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,542
快，放開電子門。
Come on, release the electronic doors.

62
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,165
馬上， Elcott 先生。
At once, Mr. Elcott.

63
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,127
好了，女士，舉起手出來。
Alright, lady, come out with your hands up.

64
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,880
有槍！那可怕的老奶奶有槍！
A gun! That horrible old lady's got a gun!

65
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,462
在這座腐敗的城市裏沒地方是安全的。
A person isn't safe any place in this rotten city.

66
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,762
你先來。我還沒結婚呢。
You first. I'm not even married.

67
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,435
我找不到那個按鈕， Elcott 先生。
I couldn't find the button, Mr. Elcott.

68
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,458
Elcott 先生！ Elcott 先生！
Mr. Elcott! Mr. Elcott!

69
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,536
他們把她困在女廁所裏了。
They've trapped her in the ladies' room.

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,131
好了，小老太太，
您要出來嗎
Alright, little old lady, are you coming out

71
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,932
還是我們要進去？
or are we coming in?

72
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,528
沒有動靜。
Nothing.

73
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,156
你有一枚一角硬幣嗎？
Do you have a dime?

74
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,871
出於對您年紀的尊重，女士
In deference to your years, madam

75
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,869
我勸您別做傻事。
I urge you not to do anything foolish.

76
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,619
- 沒有。 - 我不明白。
- Nothing. - I don't get it.

77
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,705
我想我開始明白了。
I think I'm beginning to.

78
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,881
有人丟了件外套！
Someone lost a coat!

79
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,963
那個穿黃套裝的女人！她在哪？
That dame in a yellow suit! Where is she?

80
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,050
- 走吧！ - 快走，夥計們，出去！
- Let's go! - Come on, men, get out!

81
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,065
請接伯格多夫·古德曼（Bergdorf Goodman）。
Bergdorf Goodman, please.

82
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,419
出租車！
Taxi!

83
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,882
你怎麼樣？
How are you?

84
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,096
出了什麼事？
What seems to be the trouble?

85
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,269
市聯邦銀行發生搶劫。
Stickup at the city federal bank.

86
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,221
想象一下！
Imagine!

87
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,773
五名匪徒，攜帶機關槍和催淚瓦斯。
Five bandits with machine guns and tear gas.

88
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:48,896
不！
No!

89
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,104
他們搶走了超過十三萬美元！
Got away with over 130,000 bucks!

90
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,234
竟有那麼多？
As much as that?

91
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,735
天哪。
Good gracious.

92
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,487
Elcott 先生？
Mr. Elcott?

93
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,619
恭喜，你剛剛打破了世界紀錄。
Congratulations, you've just broken the world's record.

94
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,575
開業當天就被搶。
Robbed the same day you opened.

95
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,206
把這個瘋子扔出去！
Throw this nut out!

96
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,629
他不是瘋子。
他是警察中尉。
He's not a nut. He's a police lieutenant.

97
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,752
聽起來不像個了不起的警察中尉。
He doesn't sound like much of a police lieutenant.

98
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,676
你看起來也不像個很有派頭的銀行行長。
And you don't look like much of a bank president.

99
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,970
還有一條好看的瘦腿。
你注意到了嗎？
And a good bony leg. Did you notice?

100
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,218
爲了保衛我的銀行我丟了一條褲子。
I lost my trouser defending my bank.

101
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,745
本來不必如此
Something that wouldn't have been necessary

102
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,829
如果警方及時到位。
had the police been on the job.

103
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,640
好了，好了， Elcott 先生，
您弄反了。
Now, now, Mr. Elcott, you've got it backwards.

104
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,724
先有銀行案，然後纔是警察的事。
First, there is a bank job, then there is a police job.

105
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,978
你能別這麼大聲嗎？
這對生意不好。
Do you mind lowering your voice? It's bad for business.

106
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,314
進來吧。
Come inside.

107
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,176
你應該在離開之前就想過這事
You should have thought of that before you left

108
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,067
那些散放着的500美元和1000美元的鈔票。
all those $500 and $1000 bills lying around.

109
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,889
那是開業促銷的點子。
It was a promotional idea for the opening.

110
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,199
那種面額的紙幣不容易流通。
Bank notes of that denomination aren't readily negotiable.

111
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,746
我們有所有的序列號。
We have all the serial numbers.

112
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,935
我想
這會有點困難
I guess it would be kind of tough

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,075
想把1000美元鈔票在自動售貨機裏換成零鈔。
trying to break $1000 bill in an automat.

114
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,706
是啊，但如果他們能，
Yeah, but if they could,

115
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,960
你能想象1000美元全是五分硬幣嗎？
can you imagine 1000 bucks worth of nickels?

116
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,506
我覺得這個畫面挺好笑的。
I think it's a funny image.

117
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,709
你覺得重大盜竊有趣？
You find grand larceny amusing?

118
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,386
你太緊張了。
過於緊張。
You're tense. You're much too tense.

119
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,839
這對消化很不好。
放鬆。
Very bad for the digestion. Relax.

120
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,799
保險公司，
讓他們緊張去吧。
The insurance company, let them be tense.

121
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,304
他們得賠償你的損失。
They have to make good your losses.

122
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,915
我關心的是我們的聲譽受損。
I'm concerned with our loss of prestige.

123
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,084
這種事會導致公衆失去信心。
A thing like this could cause the public to lose confidence.

124
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,939
嗯，我真想不通爲什麼。
Well, now, I can't imagine why.

125
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,796
如果我是警察中尉，
我會去找
If I were a police, lieutenant, I think I'd be out looking

126
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,607
那位紅髮女郎穿着黃色套裝，帶着6萬美元。
for $60,000 carried by a redhead in a yellow suit.

127
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,233
機率大概四十比一
The odds are, like, 40 to 1

128
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,861
那個紅髮女郎早就換下那套衣服了。
that the redhead is no longer modeling that particular number.

129
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,513
給你看， Elcott 先生。
就在影片裏。
Here you are, Mr. Elcott. Right here on film.

130
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,098
記錄了2點到3點之間發生的一切。
Everything that happened between 2:00 and 3:00.

131
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,953
搶劫發生在2:47。
The robbery took place at 2:47.

132
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,227
我們總是拍攝新銀行開業的前幾天。
We always film the first few days of a new bank's operation.

133
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,958
- 有助於消除問題。 - 真是天助我也。
- Helps eliminate the bugs. - Well, talk about dumb luck.

134
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,910
羅斯柴爾德，把這些拿到實驗室去。
Rothschild, get these down to the lab.

135
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,916
我們今晚去看電影。
We're going to the movies tonight.

136
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,299
把 Elcott 太太叫來。
她要是沒在家
Get me Mrs. Elcott. If she's not at home

137
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,430
Elcott 太太在這， Mannix 醫生。
Mrs. Elcott is here, Dr. Mannix.

138
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,059
請她進來。
Send her in.

139
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,520
- 下午好，Gregory。 - 晚上好。
- Good afternoon, Gregory. - Good evening.

140
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,694
哦，Gregory，我非常抱歉。
我就是忍不住。
Oh, Gregory, I'm terribly sorry. I just couldn't help it.

141
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,362
事情一直在發生。
Things kept happening.

142
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,321
哦，感覺真好。
Oh, that feels good.

143
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,532
我度過了這麼一天！
I've had such a day!

144
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,366
希望是美好的一天？嗯。
Good day, I hope? Mm.

145
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,874
不再逃避現實或試圖逃跑了嗎？
No more escapism or attempt to run away from reality?

146
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,877
有點兒奔，也有點兒逃避。
A little running, yes. Little escaping too.

147
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,425
嗯。你今天下午看起來真美
Hm. Well, you look so beautiful this afternoon

148
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,594
我會試着原諒你的。
I'll try to forgive it.

149
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,674
Gregory，你以前從沒說過這樣的話。
Gregory, you've never said anything like that before.

150
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,601
“春天裏，少年幻想？”
"In the spring, a young man's fancy?"

151
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,770
Penelope，我並沒有愛上你，
Penelope, I am not in love with you,

152
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,064
你也沒有愛上我。
nor are you in love with me.

153
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,984
不過根據你目前的分析，你可能會這麼想。
Although at this stage of your analysis, you may think so.

154
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,352
哦，我不認爲我愛上了你。
Oh, I don't think I'm in love with you.

155
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,486
哦，你，你不覺得你愛上了我？
Oh, you, you don't think you're in love with me?

156
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,239
沒有。這從未在我腦海中出現。
No. Never entered my mind.

157
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,910
怎麼了？你失望了嗎？
Why? Are you disappointed?

158
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,583
一點也不！
Not in the least!

159
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,287
事實上，我鬆了口氣。哦。
In fact, I'm relieved. Oh.

160
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,917
那很好。
That's good.

161
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,420
所以你過了有趣的一天，是嗎？
So you had an interesting day, huh?

162
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,212
想談談嗎？
Care to talk about it?

163
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,219
嗯，讓我想想。
Well, let's see.

164
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,217
今天早上我去購物了
This morning I went shopping

165
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,300
然後我去了現代藝術博物館。
and then I went to the museum of modern art.

166
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,385
那裏有個極好的新展覽。
They have a marvelous new exhibit there.

167
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:13,434
然後我在，嗯，廣場大飯店吃了午飯。
Then I had lunch at the, uh, Plaza.

168
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,684
棕櫚庭。
The palm court.

169
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,516
班尼迪克蛋。
Eggs Benedict.

170
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,819
然後，在三點前幾分鐘
And then, a few minutes before 3 o'clock

171
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,147
我搶劫了我丈夫的銀行。
I stuck up my husband's bank.

172
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,121
你睡着了嗎？
Are you asleep?

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,256
不，我...
No, I...

174
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,210
你沒有聯想。你——你知道嗎？
You're not associating. You-you realize that?

175
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,760
你是什麼意思？
How do you mean?

176
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,908
我是說，你說你去購物。
I mean, you said you went shopping.

177
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,243
你去了博物館，你吃了午飯。
You went to the museum, you had lunch.

178
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,757
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

179
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,809
然後你說了些完全無關的話。
And then you said something entirely irrelevant.

180
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,603
Gregory，不是我不聯想，而是你。
Gregory, it's you who's not associating.

181
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,807
我只是說我搶了我丈夫的銀行。
All I said was I stuck up my husband's bank.

182
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,892
你又說了一遍。但你不可能那樣做。
You said it again. But you couldn't possibly.

183
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,987
你怎麼知道？
How do you know?

184
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,674
因爲我當了你三年的分析師。
Because I've been your analyst for three years.

185
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:02,841
我知道你能做什麼
I know what you're capable of

186
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,526
也知道你做不到什麼。
and I know what you're not capable of.

187
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,617
你想打賭嗎？
Would you like to bet?

188
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,112
我在精神病學界的聲譽
My reputation in psychiatry

189
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,943
對你願意拿出的任何東西。
against anything you care to put up.

190
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,949
這些夠嗎？
Will this be enough?

191
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,407
那是什麼？
What's that?

192
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,542
嗯，我想那叫贓款。
Well, I think it's called the loot.

193
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,542
贓——款？
The-the loot?

194
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,793
佩—— Penelope，你能...
P-Penelope, would-would you...

195
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,469
所以你認爲你搶了銀行，是嗎？
So you think you robbed a bank, huh?

196
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,767
嗯，我一直這麼說。
Hm, I've been saying that.

197
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,140
然後我去了伯格多夫，買了這套新裝。
Then I went over to Bergdorf's and bought this new outfit.

198
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,767
你喜歡嗎？
Do you like it?

199
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,144
Penelope，你是要我相信
Penelope, do you expect me to believe

200
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,066
你搶了你丈夫的銀行
that you robbed your husband's bank

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,815
然後輕鬆地去伯格多夫
and went blithely off to Bergdorf's

202
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,612
把贓款花在裙子和貂皮上？
and spent the loot on dresses and minks?

203
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,941
- 當然不會。 - 那就好。
- Of course not. - Well, thank goodness.

204
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,152
不，我不會花贓款。
No, I wouldn't spend stolen money.

205
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,406
我有賒賬賬戶。
I have a charge account.

206
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,862
你仍然堅持你搶了銀行。
You still insist you robbed a bank.

207
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,322
那你怎麼可能呢？
Now how could you?

208
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,873
Gregory，這很簡單...
Gregory, it's very simple...

209
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,813
拜託，我——我不想聽。
我——不想聽。
Please, I-I don't wanna hear. I-I don't want to hear it.

210
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,919
我我我我不想聽這件事。
I-I-I-I don't wanna hear about it.

211
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,631
哦，當然，那會使你成爲事後從犯。
Oh, of course, that would make you an accessory after the fact.

212
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,255
Gregory，對不起。
別不高興。
Gregory, I'm sorry. Don't be upset.

213
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,428
我們就忘了我曾提起過這事。
We'll just forget I ever mentioned it.

214
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,596
我們什麼都不會忘的。
We're not going to forget about anything.

215
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,263
你——你搶了多少錢？
H-how much did you get?

216
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,391
太可怕了！
That's horrible!

217
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,848
是啊，但我剛數過了。
Yeah, but I just counted it.

218
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,478
只有略多於6萬美元。
It's only a little over 60,000.

219
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,025
所以也就只有一半那麼可怕。
So it's only half as horrible.

220
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,715
Penelope，你的生活就像一場瘋狂的魔術表演一樣不可思議。
Penelope, nobody can just walk into a bank

221
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,151
並且通過開口要來 $60,000。
and pick up $60,000 by asking for it.

222
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,823
當然可以。前提是你有槍。
Of course, you can. If you have a gun.

223
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,276
你根本沒有槍！
You don't own a gun!

224
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,828
哦，Gregory，你總是這麼樂觀。
Oh, Gregory, you're always so positive.

225
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,184
你以爲這是什麼？
What do you think this is?

226
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,750
哦，對不起。我不知道它是上膛的。
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know it was loaded.

227
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,748
我是在哪家五金店買的。
I bought it in the five and dime.

228
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,042
Penelope，這對你的治療非常不利。
Penelope, this is very bad for your therapy.

229
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,001
對不起，Gregory。
I'm sorry, Gregory.

230
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,430
在你的分析中，我顯然在某處……
Somewhere in your analysis, I have obviously...

231
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,021
錯過了一個重要的線索。
Passed up a vital clue.

232
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:05,944
現在我——我要你從頭再告訴我一次
Now I-I want you to tell me again from the beginning

233
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,112
關於你第一次拿走東西的那次。
about the first time that you took something.

234
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,946
你是說偷東西，不是嗎？
You mean stole something, don't you?

235
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,823
Gregory，我們不如面對現實。
Gregory, we might as well face it.

236
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,120
我是個偷竊狂。
I'm a kleptomaniac.

237
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,324
我拒絕從臨牀上接受那個詞。
I refuse to accept that word clinically.

238
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,662
那第一次是什麼時候？
Now what was the first time?

239
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,342
嗯，真正的第一次……
Well, the very first time...

240
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,886
是在我大學的最後一週。
Was my last week in college.

241
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,964
我盛裝打扮去參加畢業舞會，
I was all dressed up for the senior prom

242
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,390
這時 Klobb 教授過來了。
when Professor Klobb came by.

243
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,310
Klobb 教授教人類學404。
Professor Klobb taught anthropology 404.

244
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,197
他說他想在實驗室裏給我看一些照片，
And he said he'd like to show me some pictures

245
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,314
是關於 Okokos 部落的。
of the Okokos tribe in his laboratory.

246
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,028
他說 Okokos 有些非常奇怪的習俗。
He said the Okokos had some very strange customs.

247
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,989
嗯，他們確實有，
Well, they certainly did,

248
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,987
但也不比 Klobb 教授的奇怪。
but no stranger than Professor Klobb's.

249
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,125
哦！哦！
Oh! Oh!

250
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,586
哦！
Oh!

251
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,305
哦！
Oh!

252
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,677
抱歉。
Sorry.

253
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,347
哦！
Oh!

254
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,897
啊！
Ah!

255
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,104
起初我並沒有注意到，
I didn't notice it at first,

256
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,356
但我的手裏有了東西。
but there was something in my hand.

257
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,187
不知怎的，在我們的課間裏，
Somehow, sometime during our session

258
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,818
在原始人類學那節課上，
in primitive anthropology,

259
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,524
我抓住了 Klobb 教授的
I had grabbed hold of Professor Klobb's

260
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,281
懷錶鏈，鑲着鑽石的。
watch fob, diamond-studded.

261
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,112
我本來可以把它送回去，當然，
I could have sent it back, of course,

262
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,697
但我決定就留着它，
but I decided I'd just keep it

263
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,159
作爲奧科科斯部落那些奇怪習俗的紀念。
in memory of the strange customs of the Okokos tribe.

264
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,621
這就是我犯罪生涯的開始。
So that's where I began my life of crime.

265
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,330
幾乎是偶然的。
Practically by accident.

266
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,382
下一次事件是什麼時候？
When was the next incident?

267
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,930
剛來紐約時有些零零碎碎的事，
Well, there were some odds and ends

268
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,848
那是在我剛到紐約的時候。
when I first came to New York.

269
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,178
但在遇到 James 之後，我再也沒有偷過東西。
But then after I met James, I never stole anything.

270
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,182
直到……直到什麼時候？
Until... until when?

271
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,147
直到我的婚禮那天。
Until my wedding day.

272
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,903
我永遠忘不了那天 James 看起來有多英俊。
I'll never forget how handsome James looked that day.

273
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,120
我當時非常地愛他。
I was terribly in love with him.

274
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,169
但看起來，我的伴娘 Mildred Halliday 也是如此。
But so, it seems, was my matron of honor, Mildred Halliday.

275
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,871
她並非我親自選的，
She wasn't exactly my choice,

276
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,686
只是她的父親是那家銀行的董事會成員。
but her father was on the board of the bank.

277
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,344
在招待會上，James 突然消失了。
At the reception, James suddenly disappeared.

278
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,433
後來當我回想時，
When I came to think about it,

279
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,936
我好像也找不到 Mildred。
I couldn't seem to locate Mildred either.

280
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,892
我當時並不懷疑，真的，
I wasn't suspicious, really,

281
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,978
但我開始懷疑這件事也許並非不可能。
but I began to wonder if it wasn't just possible.

282
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,692
果然如此。
It was.

283
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,483
在這種情況下，
In situations like this,

284
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,035
我總會想出一些巧妙的話來說。
I always think of clever things to say.

285
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,737
好了，該切蛋糕了。
Well, time to cut the cake.

286
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,538
你好，Penelope。
Hello, Penelope.

287
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,912
Jimmy 和我剛纔在談婚禮的事。
Jimmy and I were just discussing weddings.

288
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,119
是的，我聽見了你們。
Yes, I heard you.

289
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,166
大家總是親新娘，
Well, everybody always kisses the bride,

290
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,748
但——沒人想到新郎。
but-but-but no one thinks of the groom.

291
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,049
除了你。
Except you.

292
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,377
嗯，這是我的慷慨本性。
Well, it's my generous nature.

293
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,555
哦，Jim，Jim，看看，你臉上全是口紅。
Oh, Jim, Jim, look. You're all over lipstick.

294
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,718
哦，別吃醋，親愛的。
Oh, don't be jealous, love.

295
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,519
Jimmy 和我認識很久了。
Jimmy and I have known each other for ages.

296
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,642
謝謝。
Ta.

297
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,645
謝謝。
Ta.

298
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,070
我曾一度想背後捅她一刀，
I thought briefly about stabbing her in the back,

299
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,489
但我怕蛋糕刀不夠鋒利。
but I was afraid the cake knife wasn't sharp enough.

300
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,692
你想要解釋一下嗎？
Would you care for an explanation?

301
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,995
不用，你不必這樣做。
No, you don't have to.

302
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,452
感覺如何？
How was it?

303
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,961
我可以接受也可以不接受。
I could take it or leave it.

304
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,004
你把她的口紅都擦掉了嗎？
Have you got all of her lipstick off?

305
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,253
希望沒有。怎麼了？
No, I hope. Why?

306
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,063
那時候，沒人會懷疑 James 是個銀行家。
In those days, you'd never suspect James was a banker.

307
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,105
準備好了，大家，準備！他們來了！
Ready, everybody, ready! Here they come!

308
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,812
好啦，Penelope，讓我們看看你能不能擊中未來的新娘。
Alright, Penelope, let's see you hit a future bride.

309
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,989
我仍然記得 Mildred 仰望我的樣子。
I can still see Mildred looking up at me.

310
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,162
她戴着綠寶石的耳環和項鍊，
She was wearing her emerald earrings and necklace,

311
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,285
還有一副極爲高傲的表情。
plus a very superior expression.

312
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,077
到了拋新娘花束的時候了。
It was time to toss the wedding bouquet.

313
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,254
我決定讓 Mildred 抓到它。
I decided I'd let Mildred have it.

314
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,505
哦，Mildred。
Oh, Mildred.

315
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,927
哦，親愛的，真是太抱歉了。
Oh, darling, I'm terribly sorry.

316
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,673
哦，那太好了，親愛的。
Oh, that's good, darling.

317
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,053
謝謝。
Ta.

318
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,099
- 再見，我的愛。 - 再見。
- Goodbye, my love. - Goodbye.

319
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,430
而——親愛的，親愛的，
And-and-and, darling, darling,

320
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,107
請不要忘了從此過上幸福快樂的生活。
please don't forget to live happily ever after.

321
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,981
- 我會的，再見。再見。 - 再見，James。
- I will, bye. Bye. - Goodbye, James.

322
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,687
- 再見，Douglas。 - 再見！
- Goodbye, Douglas. - Bye!

323
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,451
我的，我的耳環。我的耳環！
My, my earrings. My earrings!

324
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,029
當我們十天後回家時，
And when we returned home ten days later,

325
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,241
項鍊和耳環仍然在盆栽棕櫚的罐子裏。
the necklace and earrings were still in the potted palm jar.

326
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,953
- 你從未歸還它們嗎？ - 沒有。我爲什麼要還？
- And you never returned them? - No. Why should 1?

327
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,088
我怎麼能幫你呢？
How am I going to help you?

328
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,715
對不起，Gregory。
I'm sorry, Gregory.

329
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,887
- 我會盡量做得更好。 - 好吧。
- I'll try to do better. - Alright.

330
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,010
現在，我要你在回答前仔細想一想
Now, I want you to think very carefully

331
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,591
再回答這個問題。
before you answer this.

332
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,642
每次你偷了東西之後，
Each time you stole something,

333
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,721
你記得事後你的感受嗎？
do you remember how you felt afterwards?

334
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,021
有罪感嗎？
Guilty?

335
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,148
難過嗎？
Upset?

336
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,146
沮喪。
Depressed.

337
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,568
不安。
Disturbed.

338
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,771
開心。
Cheerful.

339
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,481
你怎麼會感到開心？
How can you feel cheerful?

340
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,283
Gregory，這就是我來找你的原因。
Gregory, that's why I'm here.

341
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,282
想找出爲什麼偷東西會讓我感到開心。
To try to find out why stealing makes me cheerful.

342
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,659
你不可能。你不可能感到開心。
You couldn't. You couldn't possibly feel cheerful.

343
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,118
這也是我沒有的一個缺點。
Which is one fault that I do not have.

344
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,624
是盜竊癖，沒錯。
Kleptomania, yes.

345
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,750
但不等於不誠實。
Dishonesty, no.

346
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,921
你不是個竊盜癖患者。
You are not a kleptomaniac.

347
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,749
竊盜癖者是出於衝動偷竊，
A kleptomaniac steals out of compulsion,

348
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,176
而你是因爲享受而偷。
but you steal because you enjoy it.

349
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,104
你生我的氣。是的，我生氣。
You're angry with me. You bet I am.

350
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,831
我們最好現在就結束這次會面。
And we better end this session right here.

351
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,190
爲什麼？因爲我……
Why? Because I...

352
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,394
因爲我發現我無法……
Because I find I cannot...

353
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:06,652
我無法保持適當的超然態度。
I cannot maintain a proper attitude of detachment.

354
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,858
而且，你的時間也到了。
And besides, your time is up.

355
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,371
是的。
Yes.

356
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,578
Elcott 先生正在給 Elcott 太太打電話。
Mr. Elcott is calling Mrs. Elcott.

357
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:20,419
哦，我想知道會有什麼緊急事。
Oh, I wonder what could be so urgent.

358
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:24,124
可能和他妻子搶他銀行這事有關。
It may have something to do with his wife sticking up his bank.

359
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,083
是的，James？
Yes, James?

360
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,509
哦。
Oh.

361
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,302
他今晚不能回家吃飯。
He won't be home for dinner.

362
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,800
爲什麼，不是親愛的？
Why not, darling?

363
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,473
不。
No.

364
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,347
看在上帝的份上。
For heaven's sakes.

365
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,474
什麼？
What?

366
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,806
你有？
You have?

367
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,106
什麼時候？
When?

368
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,400
哦，James，我可以去嗎？
Oh, James, can I come?

369
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,897
哦，謝謝你，親愛的。
Oh, thank you, darling.

370
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,571
是的，是的，是的，我保證不會遲到。
Yes, yes, yes, I promise I won't be late.

371
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,818
Gregory，猜怎麼着？
Gregory, guess what?

372
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,365
他們有搶劫的影片，
They have movies of the robbery,

373
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,818
James 會讓我和警察一起看。
and James is gonna let me see them with the police.

374
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,074
我在鏡頭裏。多激動啊！
I'm on film. Isn't that exciting?

375
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,451
就像演員拍試鏡一樣。
It's just like an actress having a screen test.

376
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,285
只不過你如果演了這個角色，就得在監獄裏演。
Except that you get this part, you're gonna play it in jail.

377
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,619
Gregory，我得走了。
Gregory, I'd better run.

378
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,330
還有一千件事要做。拜拜。
I've got a thousand things to do first. Bye.

379
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,682
謝謝你，Gregory。我什麼時候再見你？
Thank you, Gregory. When do I see you again?

380
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,633
表現良好，差不多二十年以後。
With good behavior, in about 20 years.

381
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,845
明天，同一時間。同一時間。
Tomorrow, same time. Same time.

382
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,899
假如你還逍遙法外的話。
Assuming you're still at large.

383
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,123
Knoblock 醫生，我想是時候繼續我的分析了。
Dr. Knoblock, I think it's time we resume my analysis.

384
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,833
你看，我已經愛上了這個女竊賊……
You see, I've fallen in love with this bank robber...

385
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,049
- 哦，我能幫你嗎？ - 哦，是的，夫人。
- Oh, may I help you? - Oh, oui, madame.

386
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,923
我帶來一套西裝，想捐給你們的慈善機構。
I have here a suit to donate to your charity.

387
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,174
哦，謝謝你。
Oh, thank you.

388
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,426
呃，收據要寫給誰？
Uh, to whom shall we make out the receipt?

389
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,351
- 再見。 - 這可以免稅，你知道的。
- Bye. - It's tax deductible, you know.

390
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,266
等一下。
Wait a minute.

391
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,727
等一下！
Wait a minute!

392
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,434
太漂亮了。我就要了。
It's gorgeous. I'll take it.

393
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,611
- 你來晚了！ - 嘿！
- You are too late! - Say!

394
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,050
- 哦，求你了！ - 你在幹什麼？
- Oh, please! - What are you doing?

395
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,032
女士們！女士們！女士們！女士們！
Ladies! Ladies! Ladies! Ladies!

396
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,952
這麼大的騷動。爲了什麼？
Such a big commotion. Over what?

397
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,120
某件黃色的破布？
Some yellow rag?

398
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,665
這種顏色不適合你那病態的膚色。
The color's all wrong for your sallow complexion.

399
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:08,337
而黃？對你這年齡的女人來說更不合適。
And yellow? On a woman of your years?

400
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,460
你打算爲這件付多少錢，女士？
How much were you going to pay for this, lady?

401
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,634
嗯，呃，20美元。好像公平。
Well, uh, uh, $20. That seems fair.

402
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,963
- 21。 - 這是破損貨。看。
- 21. - It's damaged goods. Look.

403
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,174
那樣的話，不管多少錢我都不感興趣。
In that case, I'm not interested at any price.

404
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,055
那我也不感興趣了。
Then neither am I.

405
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,470
哦，親愛的。
Oh, dear.

406
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,227
這是 7 美元。
Here's $7.

407
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,060
比它值的還多。
More than it's worth.

408
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,192
不過我就是這麼個軟心腸的人。
But then I'm such a soft touch.

409
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,363
哦。
Oh.

410
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,329
Sadaba，我的生命之愛，
Sadaba, love of my life,

411
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:53,712
你知道我們這裏有什麼嗎？
do you know what we have here?

412
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,258
那不可能。
It couldn't be.

413
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,085
但它絕不會是別的東西。
But it couldn't be anything else.

414
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,844
沒人，沒人能像 Givenchy 那樣縫合。
Nobody, nobody does seams like Givenchy.

415
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,767
一件來自巴黎的原作，7 美元。
A Paris original for $7.

416
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,310
你太聰明瞭。
You're a genius.

417
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,854
愛上天使。
In love with an angel.

418
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,647
你那富有的天使。
Your rich angel.

419
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,532
在店裏我們能賣到 500 美元。
In the shop, we'll get $500 for this.

420
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,655
加上掛架，一共六件。
And a good hanger, six.

421
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,916
請幫助窮人。
Please help the poor.

422
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,547
請朋友們，敞開你們的心。
Please, friends, open your hearts.

423
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,307
主愛喜樂地施予者。
The lord loves a cheerful giver.

424
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,982
請朋友們，敞開你們的心。
Please, friends, open your hearts.

425
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,980
幫助他人。
Help others.

426
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,201
打擾一下，先生。
Pardon, monsieur.

427
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,779
施比受更爲有福，不是嗎？
It is more blessed to give than to take, no?

428
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,205
是的，我們被教導如此。
So we've been taught. Yes.

429
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,159
嗯，可惜不是相反的那樣。
Hm, too bad it is not the other way around.

430
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,494
是啊。
Yes.

431
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,931
謝謝，謝謝。
Thank you. Thank you.

432
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,321
嘿，等一下，我忘了我的...
Hey, wait a minute, I forgot my...

433
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,944
算了。
Never mind.

434
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,179
Cracker Jack?

435
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,257
我們馬上就看到嫌疑人的
We're coming up on our first good look

436
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,183
第一張清晰臉孔了。
at the suspect right here.

437
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,056
- 終於。 - 是時候了。
It's about time.

438
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,692
- 現在怎樣？ - 哦，是我太太。
- Now what? - Oh, it's my wife.

439
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,690
呃，親愛的，中士 Bixbee。
Uh, darling, lieutenant Bixbee.

440
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,693
- 你好嗎？ - 還有羅斯柴爾德中士。
- How do you do? - And sergeant Rothschild.

441
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,524
你好。
Hello.

442
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,531
我是不是錯過什麼了？
Am I, uh, missing anything?

443
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,487
從我站的地方看還沒丟什麼東西。
Not from where I'm standin'.

444
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,119
呃，中士，你既然在倒帶，
Uh, sergeant, as long as you're rewinding that

445
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,292
爲什麼不從頭開始給 Elcott 太太看？
why don't you start from the top for Mrs. Elcott?

446
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,915
哦，那真是太好了。
Oh, that's very kind.

447
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,213

00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,551
你的鞋子？親愛的，你的鞋子在哪？
Your shoes? Where are your shoes, darling?

450
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,888
噢，真巧。我把鞋落在出租車裏了。
Oh, wouldn't you know it? I left them in the taxi.

451
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,106
上週是在電梯裏。
Last week, it was in the elevator.

452
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,062
我可以發出尋物通告。
I could send out an all-points bulletin.

453
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,760
我希望你在找我太太的鞋子比找我銀行被搶一案更有運氣。
I hope you have more luck with my wife's shoes

454
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,220
你的銀行，我的竊賊。記得嗎。

455
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,986
哦，這太刺激了。
Your bank, my robber. Remember.

456
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,868
Oh, this is so exciting.

00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,459
James，就是你。
James, that's you.

458
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,675
哦，James，你看起來真英俊。
Oh, James, you look so handsome.

459
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,928
什麼時候能看到那個女孩？
When do we get to see the girl?

460
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,130
現在。
Right now.

461
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,302
她在那兒了。
There she is.

462
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,023
讓開路！
Out of the way!

463
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,598
我看不到她！
I can't see her!

464
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,684
哦，也許還有更多。
Oh, maybe there's more.

465
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,610
- 轉過來！轉過來！ - 是的，轉過來！
- Turn around! Turn around! - Yes, turn around!

466
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,191
把膠片放慢。
Slow down the film.

467
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,200
哦，她不見了。
Oh, she's gone.

468
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,910
把那部分倒回去。
Run that part backwards.

469
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,087
哦，我喜歡那一幕。
Oh, I like that.

470
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,137
好了，就這些了。
Well, that's it.

471
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,313
嫌疑人，年輕的白人女性，
Suspect, young white female,

472
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,016
身高 5 英尺 3 英寸，紅髮，黃色套裝。
5'3", red hair, yellow suit.

473
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,692
我忘了什麼嗎？
Did I forget anything?

474
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,269
是的，從後面看時，
Yeah, when viewed from behind,

475
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,650
她的後襬非常吸引人地擺動。
she has a very attractive wiggle.

476
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,654
- 打擾一下，Elcott 太太。- 沒關係。
Excuse me, Mrs. Elcott. -not at all.

477
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,656
幫不上太大忙，是嗎？
Not much help, was it?

478
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:34,329
不。真遺憾。
No. What a shame.

479
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:37,032
別人臉都很清楚。
Everyone else's face was so clear.

480
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,663
你看起來真棒, James。
You were very good, James.

481
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,995
而 Serena 小姐簡直棒極了。
And miss Serena was just fabulous.

482
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,172
是的，考慮到她一直張着嘴。
Yeah, considering she kept her mouth open all the time.

483
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,669
嗯。
Mm.

484
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,503
順便說一句，你們的攝像機位置很有策略性。
Incidentally, your cameras are very strategically located.

485
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:52,181
我們可沒料到會拍到女洗手間。
We weren't expecting to photograph the ladies' washroom.

486
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,683
是的，Bixbee。
Yeah. Bixbee.

487
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,106
哦，很好。
Oh, very good.

488
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:04,438
我們破案的第一個突破。
Our first break in the case.

489
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,896
這麼快？我可能低估你了。
So soon? I may have underestimated you.

490
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,107
幹得好，警官。
Good work, officer.

491
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,693
我們在時代廣場設了路障。
We set up a roadblock in Times Square.

492
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,124
中尉，你真貼心。
Lieutenant, how dear of you.

493
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,579
哦，James，他真體貼，不是嗎？
Oh, James, wasn't that sweet of him?

494
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,913
可愛。
Adorable.

495
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,544
Bixbee 中尉？
Lieutenant Bixbee?

496
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,588
我已經給過了。
I already gave.

497
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,171
哦，我是 Higgins 少校。
Oh, I'm major Higgins.

498
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,756
我很忙。
I'm very busy.

499
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,162
聽聽，這哪是一箇中尉對
Well, that's a fine way for a lieutenant

500
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,471
少校該有的說話態度！
to talk to a major.

501
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,518
呃，呃，中尉，
Uh, uh, lieutenant,

502
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,724
我想請問這是真的還是假的。
I was wondering if you could tell me if this is real.

503
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,810
打擾一下。
Excuse me a minute.

504
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,867
少校，你從哪兒弄到這個的？
Major, where did you get this?

505
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:59,244
一位年輕女士在大約五點鐘把它放進我的鼓裏。
A young lady put it in my tambourine about 5 o'clock.

506
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,369
你能描述她嗎？
Could you describe her?

507
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,745
她的衣着，她的膚色？
Her clothes, her coloring?

508
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,122
身高，身材如何？
Her height, her figure?

509
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,857
呃，Elcott 太太，你能站起來嗎？
Uh, Mrs. Elcott, would you stand up, please?

510
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,337
哦，當然。
Oh, of course.

511
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,633
是的，是的，她大約和這位小姐一樣高。
Yes, yes, she was just about this young lady's height.

512
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,216
而且身材也差不多。
And figure.

513
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,058
只是……
Only...

514
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,186
只是什麼？
Only what?

515
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,894
只是金髮。
Only with blond hair.

516
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,067
還有別的嗎？有的。
Anything else? Yes.

517
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,942
她帶着法國口音說話而且……
She spoke with a French accent and...

518
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,361
她臉頰上有一粒痣。
She had a mole on her cheek.

519
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,286
打擾一下，就在這裏。
Excuse me. Right here.

520
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,071
謝謝。
Thank you.

521
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,324
你還記得她說了什麼嗎？
Can you remember anything she said?

522
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,785
是的，我相信她的原話是
Yes, I believe her exact words were

523
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,089
“施比受更有福，不是嗎？”
"it is more blessed to give than to take, no?"

524
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,087
哦，我們需要像她這樣的人。
Oh, we need workers like her.

525
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,214
那麼樂於助人，那麼，呃……
So willing, so, uh...

526
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,799
快樂？快樂。
Cheerful? Cheerful.

527
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,678
是的，是的，那正是這個詞。快樂。
Yes, yes, that's the exact word. Cheerful.

528
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,884
是的，她看起來是個可愛的人。
Yeah, she seemed such a sweet person.

529
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,393
錢不是很好嗎？
Isn't the money good?

530
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,600
嗯，對你來說不行，少校。
Well, not for you, major.

531
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,150
這張鈔票是今天下午被盜的
This bill was stolen this afternoon

532
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,102
從 Elcott 先生的銀行。
from Mr. Elcott's bank.

533
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,565
哦，那真讓我很抱歉。
Well, I'm sorry about that.

534
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,490
但我只是抱有一線希望。
But I was just hoping.

535
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,496
哦，好吧。
Oh, well.

536
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,996
少校，等等！
Major, wait!

537
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,828
Bixbee 中尉，這不公平。
Lieutenant Bixbee, this is unfair.

538
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,834
法律不必公平。這就是法律。
It doesn't have to be fair. It's the law.

539
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,837
什麼法律？我從未聽說過這種法律。
What law? I never heard of any such law.

540
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,213
我的意思是，他爲什麼不能留着它？
I mean, why can't he keep it?

541
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,262
畢竟，他並沒有偷它。有人把它給了他。
After all, he didn't steal it. Somebody gave it to him.

542
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,465
那不是她有權贈與的，親愛的。
It wasn't hers to give, darling.

543
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,844
但他需要它。
But he needs it.

544
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,222
你就什麼都不能做嗎？
Isn't there anything you can do?

545
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,644
恐怕不行。
I'm afraid not.

546
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,309
那好，James，你來做點什麼吧。
Well, then, James, you do something.

547
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,109
呃，比如什麼？
Uh, like what?

548
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,859
給 Higgins 少校開一張支票。
Write major Higgins a check.

549
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,817
- 爲了什麼，親愛的？ - 爲一千美元。
- For what, darling? - For $1000.

550
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,698
那就是你要從他那裏拿走的。
That's what you're taking from him.

551
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,871
- 拿走？ - 當然了。
- Taking? - Well, of course.

552
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,370
而且，你會打平賬。
And besides, you'll be breaking even.

553
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,872
親愛的，你這是怎麼想出來的？
How do-how do you figure that out, darling?

554
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,205
因爲 Higgins 少校把你的 1000 美元還給了你，
Well, major Higgins gave you back your $1000.

555
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,336
你把他的 1000 美元還給他。很簡單。
You give him back his $1000. Simple.

556
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,091
我聽到的是嗎？真不敢相信。
Am I hearing right? I can't believe this.

557
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,888
James！
James!

558
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,638
如果你不給 Higgins 少校開支票，
If you don't give major Higgins a check,

559
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,218
我就再也不跟你說話了。
I'll never speak to you again.

560
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,895
哦，拜託，諸位，拜託。
Oh, please, folks, please.

561
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,020
我們的職責是減輕別人的煩惱，不是製造煩惱。
We're meant to ease people's troubles, not to cause them.

562
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,601
對不起。
I'm sorry.

563
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,270
拜託，James。
Please, James.

564
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,002
哦，謝謝你，親愛的。
Oh, thank you, darling.

565
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,923
五百？
Five hundred?

566
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,550
一千。
A thousand.

567
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,005
一千。
A thousand.

568
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,429
等着吧，這件事傳到
Wait till word of this reaches

569
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,307
紅十字會、基督教青年會和哈達薩會去。
Red Cross, YMCA and Hadassah.

570
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,069
你知道嗎？
And do you know what?

571
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:21,025
James 仍然不明白他在這筆交易中是打平了。
James still doesn't understand that he broke even on the deal.

572
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,943
也許他只是固執。
Maybe he was just being stubborn.

573
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,746
不，他只是糊塗。
No, he's just confused.

574
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,245
對一個銀行家來說，這很奇怪。
For a banker, I think that's pretty strange.

575
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,967
這些牛奶都對你有好處嗎？
Is all this milk good for you?

576
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,755
不是給我的，是給我的潰瘍的。
It's not for me, it's for my ulcer.

577
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,516
你知道，Bixbee 中尉非常好
You know, lieutenant Bixbee was so nice

578
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,514
幫我找回我的鞋子。
about getting back my shoes.

579
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,771
你猜我爲什麼拿了它們？
Why do you suppose I took this?

580
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,017
Gregory。
Gregory.

581
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,151
噎着了嗎？
Go down the wrong pipe?

582
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,819
Penelope。
Penelope.

583
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,241
Penelope。
Penelope.

584
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,406
Penelope，你有沒有想過
Penelope, did you, did you ever think

585
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,238
去看另一位精神科醫生？
of going to another psychiatrist?

586
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,791
不，那樣不忠誠。
No, that would be disloyal.

587
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,494
我一點也幫不了你。
I'm not helping you at all.

588
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,714
當然你幫了。
Of course you are.

589
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,383
Gregory，對不起。我會把錢包寄回去。
Gregory, I'm sorry. I'll send the wallet back.

590
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,210
不止是這個。
It's not only this.

591
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,719
哦，別因爲我搶了家銀行就氣餒。
Oh, don't be discouraged just because I stuck up a bank.

592
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,391
是你丈夫的銀行。
Your husband's bank.

593
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,309
是的，James 的銀行。
Yeah, James' bank.

594
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,934
爲什麼是他那家銀行？爲什麼不是別人的？
Why his bank? Why not somebody else's bank?

595
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,391
你爲什麼用左手寫字？
Why are you writing left-handed?

596
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,564
我是事後幫助掩護的人。
I'm being an accessory after the fact.

597
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,363
你介意替我舔一下這個嗎？
Would you mind licking this for me?

598
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,162
我太乾了。
I'm too dry.

599
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,043
你當初怎麼會嫁給那樣的男人？
Whatever made you marry a man like that in the first place?

600
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,590
哦，James 起初並不是那種男人。
Oh, James wasn't a man like that in the first place.

601
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,008
哦，不。
Oh, no.

602
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,762
我第一次遇到 James 是在格林威治村的一個酒窖裏
The first time I met James was at a Greenwich village cellar

603
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,840
叫做 Plush Pig。
known as the plush pig.

604
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,765
我在那裏工作了幾個月。
I'd been working there a couple of months.

605
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,844
那是我在紐約的第一份正經工作。
It was my first real job in New York.

622
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,661
魔鬼的小提琴在說話。
The devil's fiddle speaks.

623
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:36,655
嗨。
Hi.

624
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,617
- 嗯。Penelope Gordon 小姐？ - 嗯哼。
- Huh. Miss Penelope Gordon? - Mm-hm.

625
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,545
如果你坐下，就不用彎着腰了。
If you sit down, you won't have to scrunch over.

626
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,748
我可以請你喝一杯，但只有水。
I'd offer you a drink, but it's only water.

627
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,799
你介意我把眼睛取出來嗎？
Would you excuse me while I take out my eyes?

628
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:59,762
我是 James Elcott，市聯邦銀行。
I'm James Elcott, city federal bank.

629
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,063
嗯，隱形眼鏡。
Hm, contacts.

630
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,731
哦，現在我能看得更清楚你了。
Oh, now I can see you much better.

631
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:10,359
好吧，我從沒和銀行握過手。
Well, I never shook hands with a bank before.

632
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,696
Penelope Gordon 小姐，我怎麼沒收到你的來信？
How is it I haven't heard from you, miss Gordon?

633
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,073
嗯，可能是因爲我們剛認識不久。
Well, it's probably because we've only just met.

634
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,747
但在過去兩個月我給你寫了九封信。
But I've written you nine times in the last two months.

635
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,450
哦，你真喜歡民謠，是嗎？
Oh, you really love folk songs, do you?

636
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,207
並不完全是。不，這事是公務。
Not exactly. No, this is business.

637
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,540
市聯邦接受了一個小遺產的受託管理
City federal has accepted trusteeship of a modest estate

638
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,250
是你母親的表親留給你的。
left to you by your mother's cousin.

639
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,506
你確定是對的 Penelope Gordon 嗎？
Are you sure you've got the right Penelope Gordon?

640
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:33,597
絕對。
Absolutely.

641
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,281
遺產的收入不會很多，
The income from the estate won't be much,

642
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,635
但有些文件需要簽字。
but there are papers to sign.

643
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,468
你真的從未收到過我的任何信嗎？
You're certain you never received any of my letters?

644
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,974
啊，我知道怎麼回事了。
Ah, I know what happened.

645
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:44,898
你看，我從不打開我的郵件。
You see, I never open my mail.

646
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,520
哦，誰替你打開？
Oh, who does it for you?

647
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,727
- 沒有人。 - 那郵件都去哪兒了？
- Nobody. - What happens to it?

648
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,984
通常我把它塞進抽屜裏某處，
Well, usually, I stick it away in a drawer someplace

649
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,693
然後總是忘了或丟了。
and then I always forget it or it gets lost.

650
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,323
你不會因此失去很多朋友嗎？
Don't you lose a lot of friends that way?

651
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,996
哦，不，正好相反。
Oh, no, just the opposite.

652
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,996
你看，如果你寫信給我而我回信，
You see, if you write me a letter and I answer it,

653
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,668
那你就得回我信。
then you have to answer mine.

654
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:08,108
然後我回答你的第二封，你得寫第三封
Then I answer your second letter and you have to write me a third

655
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,247
並回答我的第二封。
and answer to my second.

656
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,569
然後我得寫第三封，
And then I have to write you a third

657
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:11,924
你得寄第四封。
and you have to send me a fourth.

658
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,365
很快，我們忙着互相寫信，
And pretty soon, we're so busy writing letters to each other

659
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,175
就沒時間做朋友了。
we haven't got time to be friends.

660
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,054
是嗎？
Isn't that true?

661
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:24,683
嗯，我從沒這麼想過，嗯。
Uh, I-i-I never, I never thought of it like that, hm.

662
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,231
無論如何，我可以回家再找找你的信。
Well, anyway, I-I could still look for your letters at home.

663
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,318
那有幫助嗎？
Would that help?

664
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,644
嗯，我們應該討論這些，是的。
Well, we ought to discuss them, yes.

665
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,063
哦，親愛的。
Oh, dear.

666
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,523
怎麼了？
What is it?

667
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,280
我把隱形眼鏡掉了。我總是弄丟它們。
I've dropped my contact lens. I'm always losing them.

668
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:39,736
哦，別把褲子弄髒。
Oh, oh, don't get your pants dirty.

669
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,742
哦，沒事的。
Oh, that's alright.

670
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,495
你、嗯，你覺得我們可以、呃，
Do you, um, do you think we could, uh,

671
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,746
明天找個時間見面嗎？
get together sometime tomorrow?

672
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,749
哦，當然，吃個晚飯怎麼樣？
Oh, sure, how about dinner?

673
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,751
我——我要請些朋友來。
I-I'm gonna have some friends in.

674
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,754
呃，那太好了。
Uh, that's wonderful.

675
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,632
哦，這些隱形眼鏡，真小。
Oh, these contacts, they're so tiny.

676
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,259
我們怎麼可能找到它們呢。
We're never going to find them.

677
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,555
那，有關係嗎？
Well, does it matter?

678
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,758
你自己不是說過不用它們看得更清楚嗎。
You said yourself, you can see better without them.

679
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,389
哦，清楚多了。
Oh, much better.

680
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,969
我想以前和我約會的那位驗光師
I think this optometrist I was dating

681
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,770
給了我錯的處方。
gave me the wrong prescription.

682
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,395
我能問你件事嗎？
May I ask something?

683
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,401
你爲什麼戴它們？
Why do you wear them?

684
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,695
嗯，他說它們能讓我的眼睛顯得有神采。
Well, he said they make my eyes look luminous.

685
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,070
我覺得我的眼睛本來就很有神采了。
I think they're luminous already.

686
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,236
而且也挺漂亮的。
And quite beautiful.

687
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,413
哦，那好，那麼我就不用戴隱形眼鏡了，是嗎？
Oh, well, then I don't need to wear the contacts, do I?

688
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,501
我很高興你來看我。
I'm glad you came to see me.

689
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,796
我也是。
So am I.

690
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,843
我很期待明晚。
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.

691
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,762
我也是。
So am I.

692
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,892
現在我想起來了，可以請你站起來嗎？
And now I'd like to get up, please.

693
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,018
什麼？
Pardon?

694
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,270
你跪在我的頭髮上了。
You're kneeling on my hair.

695
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,241
- 哦，我太... - 哦，小心那個...
- Oh, I'm terribly... - Oh, watch out for the...

696
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:57,898
菸斗。
Pipe.

697
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,824
哦，天哪。哦。
Oh, dear. Oh.

698
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,824
真是非常抱歉。
I'm terribly sorry.

699
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:04,915
你還好嗎？
A-are you alright?

700
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,990
沒事，完全沒事。
It's alright. Quite alright.

701
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,246
沒什麼好擔心的。
There's nothing to concern yourself about.

702
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:12,714
哎呀。
Oh, dear.

703
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,547
哦，你找到了我的隱形眼鏡。
Oh, you found my contact lens.

704
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,199
嗯？
Yeah?

705
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,070
Penelope Gordon 小姐？
Miss Penelope Gordon?

706
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,871
這是銀行嗎？
Is this the bank?

707
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,745
是的。我上去嗎？
Yes. Shall I come up?

708
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,578
不用了，你可以在樓下等。
No, but you're welcome down here.

709
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,006
明白了。
Got it.

710
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,269
希望我在村子裏穿得不過分隆重。
I hope I'm not overdressed for the village.

711
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,725
不會的，我不會這麼說。
No, I wouldn't say so.

712
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,685
進來，認識大家吧。
Come on in and meet everybody.

713
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,563
大家，這是 James Elcott。
Everybody, meet James Elcott.

714
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,578
你這打扮不像個銀行家。
You're dressed funny for a banker.

715
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,460
- 我可以回家換衣服。 - 哦，不，我覺得很可愛。
- I could go home and change. - Oh, no, I think it's sweet.

716
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,792
你爲我們打扮，我們也爲你打扮。
You dressed for us and we dressed for you.

717
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,427
Penelope，幫忙。
Penelope, help.

718
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,992
你知道這種場合會讓我緊張。
You know these things make me nervous.

719
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,927
別慌，Sebastian。救援馬上到。
Don't panic, Sebastian. Help is on the way.

720
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,885
- 我就一會兒。 - 我會記着你的。
- I'll just be a sec. - I'm going to hold you to that.

721
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,719
我瞭解你。
I know you.

722
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,930
你在市聯邦銀行存錢嗎？
Do you bank at city federal?

723
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,390
我把錢塞在牀墊裏。
I bank in my mattress.

724
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,440
那也不錯。
Well, that's nice too.

725
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,940
昨晚在 Plush Pig，
Last night at plush pig,

726
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,521
你在我重要的那段演出時走了。
you walked out on my big number.

727
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,106
是個無心的冒犯。
An unintentional slight.

728
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,943
話說得輕巧。現在想聽嗎？
Talk's cheap. Wanna hear it now?

729
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,824
- 就在這兒，沒有你的樂隊？ - 我會假唱給你聽。
- Right here without your band? - I'll fake it for you.

730
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,701
我要去把我的朋友從 Boom Boom 那兒救出來。
I've got to rescue my friend from boom boom.

731
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,281
我要去救那位商人。
I shall rescue the businessman.

732
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,912
請把我的禮物講完。
Please finish my present.

733
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,127
畢竟這是你的生日。
Well, it's your birthday.

734
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,775
來段《Greensleeves》快版如何？
How about a fast arrangement of "Greensleeves?"

735
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,209
等一下，Boom Boom。那個人是我的。
Just a minute, boom boom. He's mine.

736
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,212
哦，拜託，Sebastian。
Oh, come on, Sebastian.

737
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,300
我敢說你在哪兒都能適應。
I bet you fit in any place.

738
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,055
- 我喜歡你的朋友。 - 他們隨租約一塊來的。
- I like your friends. - They came with the lease.

739
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,980
那也隨租約帶來的嗎？
Did that come with the lease too?

740
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,185
不是。我曾和一個焊工約會過。
No. I used to date this welder.

741
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,486
他一定是個糟糕的司機。
He must have been an awful driver.

742
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,282
不，我還有一個男朋友，開廢品場的。
No, I had this other boyfriend who owns a junkyard.

743
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:48,030
你男朋友真多，不是嗎？
You got a lot of boyfriends, haven't you?

744
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,281
嗯。你是我的第一個銀行家。
Hm. You're my first banker.

745
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,613
爲什麼要到處逛？
Why all this shopping around?

746
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,447
如果你不試所有東西，
Well, if you don't try everything

747
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,828
怎麼知道自己真正喜歡什麼？
how are you gonna find out what you really like?

748
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,128
孩童之言真是金玉良言。
Out of the mouths of babes.

749
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,682
又來？
Again?

750
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:31,277
大家都去哪兒了？
Where did everybody go?

751
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,658
他們都在這兒。
They're all here.

752
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,924
三週後，我們結婚了。
Three weeks later, we got married.

753
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:53,474
匆匆忙忙，好像不結婚會死掉似的。
All in a rush. Like if we didn't, we'd die.

754
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,643
如果你老公還是那個
And if your husband was still the same

755
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,846
浪漫格林威治村 James，
romantic Greenwich village James,

756
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,805
你現在還會去偷東西嗎？
would you be stealing now?

757
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,391
哦，James 沒有時間談浪漫了。
Oh, James hasn't got time for romance.

758
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,522
他太忙於銀行工作。
He's too busy banking.

759
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,898
所以你還偷嗎？
So you steal?

760
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,114
你對這事過於冷靜了。
You're much too calm about it.

761
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,816
我爲什麼不能冷靜？
Well, why shouldn't I be calm?

762
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,402
畢竟，沒有什麼能把我和搶劫聯繫起來。
After all, there's nothing to connect me with the robbery.

763
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,906
除了那件黃色套裝。
Except the yellow suit.

764
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,413
你知道警察在全城搜尋它嗎。
You realize the police are combing the city for it.

765
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,664
嗯，我有看到報道。
Mm, so I've read.

766
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,462
我已經處理掉了。
I took care of it.

767
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,584
你把它燒了嗎？
You burned it?

768
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,041
沒有，我把它捐給了舊貨店。
No, I gave it away to a thrift shop.

769
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,421
舊貨店？
Thrift shop?

770
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,032
你知道你這樣做有多冒險嗎？
Do you realize the chance you're taking?

771
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:31,842
我不知道。
I don't know.

772
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,672
也許我會去把它買回來。
Maybe I'll go buy it back.

773
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,850
買回來？不，不行！
Buy it? No, no!

774
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,142
Penny，看。
Penny, look.

775
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,185
你這是想被抓嗎，嗯？
Are you trying to get caught, mm?

776
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,168
你根本就不該去那兒。
You never should have gone there in the first place.

777
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,478
那我還能怎麼辦？把它扔掉？
Well, what else could I do? Throw it away?

778
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,230
那樣會安全得多。
It would have been a lot safer.

779
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,358
Gregory，那是件 Givenchy 套裝。
Gregory, it was a Givenchy suit.

780
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,780
然後呢？
So?

781
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,324
你不能把 Givenchy 扔進下水道。
Well, you can't just throw a Givenchy down a manhole.

782
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,696
那簡直是褻瀆。
It's sacrilege.

783
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,700
再說，James 爲那套衣服付了1100美元，
And besides, James paid $1100 for that suit

784
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,453
我可不想看到他浪費錢。
and I wouldn't like to see him waste his money.

785
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,143
嗨。Bixbee 中尉。羅斯柴爾德中士。
Hi. Lieutenant Bixbee. Sergeant Rothschild.

786
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,644
真是個意外的驚喜。
What a nice surprise.

787
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,568
Elcott 太太，你經常來這兒買嗎？
Mrs. Elcott, do you shop here?

788
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,897
是的，我常來。他們有許多有趣的東西。
Yes, I often drop by. They have fascinating things.

789
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,824
他們昨天確實有。那兒有那件黃色套裝。
They did yesterday. They had the yellow suit.

790
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,902
並非完全如此。
Not really.

791
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:36,996
他們怎麼得到的？
How did they get it?

792
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,183
嗯，他們得到它的方式和
Well, they got it the same way

793
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:40,619
Higgins 少校弄到那張1000美元鈔票的方式一樣。
that major Higgins got his $1000 bill.

794
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,701
是個金髮的女孩捐的，她帶着裝出來的法國口音。
It was donated by a blond girl with a phony French accent.

795
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,003
- 然後我們追查到了這裏。 - 真聰明啊你們。
- And we traced it here. - Well, how clever of you.

796
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,317
也沒那麼聰明。
Well, not so clever.

797
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,003
後面那位女士在報上看到後打電話給我們。
The lady back there read about it in the paper and called us.

798
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,005
但我們還夠聰明，接了電話。
But we were clever enough to pick up the phone.

799
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,339
好，那就這樣。你們找到了。
Well, that's that. You've got it.

800
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,925
還沒呢。有人買走了。只付了七塊錢。
Not yet. Somebody bought it. Paid seven bucks.

801
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,136
- 七塊？那…… - 怎麼了？太便宜嗎？
- Seven bucks? But that... - What? Too cheap?

802
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,267
這也說不準。
Well, that's hard to say.

803
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,723
我得先看看。
I'd have to see it first.

804
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,712
那你爲何不和我們一塊去拿呢？
Well, why don't you come along while we pick it up?

805
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,146
我能坐警車嗎？
Do I get to ride in a police car?

806
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,900
可以，有警笛，還有一切配備。
Yeah, with a siren and everything.

807
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,705
羅斯柴爾德中士總是這麼開車嗎？
Does sergeant Rothschild always drive like that?

808
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,999
他只是稍微賣弄一下而已。
He was just showin' off a little.

809
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,912
這是我第一次有機會參加警察突襲。
This is the first police raid I've ever been invited to.

810
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,713
你們要把門撞開嗎？
Are you gonna break down the door?

811
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,257
那種做法隨禁酒令時代一起過去了。
Well, you see, that went out with prohibition.

812
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,255
現在我們有了全新的形象。
Now we have a whole new image.

813
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,678
既時髦又有禮貌。
It's very suave and very couth.

814
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,557
所以進去後，你就跟着我做就行了。
So when we get inside, you just take your cue from me.

815
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,644
明白，長官。
Right, chief.

816
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,390
那是中尉，Elcott 太太。
That's lieutenant, Mrs. Elcott.

817
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,937
那是 Penelope，中尉。
That's Penelope, lieutenant.

818
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,733
Horatio。我的父親很愛讀書。
Horatio. My father read a lot.

819
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,316
嗯。嗯。
Mm. Mm.

820
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,695
嗯。嗯。
Mm. Mm.

821
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,124
哦，親愛的。
Oh, cherie.

822
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,579
這纔是我認爲的經典醃牛肉三明治。
Now that's what I call a vintage pastrami.

823
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,413
嗯哼。嗯。
Mm-hm. Mm.

824
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,509
嗯。
Mm.

825
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,709
美味的蒔蘿醃黃瓜...
Delish dill pickle...

826
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,679
沒什麼好挑剔的。
Is nothing to throw rocks at.

827
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,721
我感覺有點胃灼熱要起來了。
I feel a slight heartburn building up.

828
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,851
快，我的天使，奶油汽水。
Quickly, my angel, the cream soda.

829
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,413
啊，午安，女士們先生們。
Ah, good afternoon, lady and gentleman.

830
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,836
歡迎來到Princess Sadaba的沙龍。
Welcome to the salon of Princess Sadaba.

831
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,289
這家精品店非常時髦。
The boutique très chic.

832
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,677
- 你好。 - 啊，這國產香檳。
- Salut. - Ah, this domestic champagne.

833
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:02,803
啊，Princess Sadaba能爲您做些什麼？
Ah, and what can Princess Sadaba do for you?

834
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,680
別告訴我，我知道。
Don't tell me, I know.

835
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,979
身材如此迷人，您顯然
With such a lovely figure, you have obviously

836
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:12,809
是來爲Sadaba的某件華麗晚禮服而來。
come for one of Sadaba's divine evening gowns.

837
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,895
哦，不，是套裝。或者說是一套套裝。
Oh, no, a suit. Or a suit.

838
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:18,527
你看，Sadaba 是多麼懂得。
You see how Sadaba knows.

839
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,359
我想要亮色的，我要去波託菲諾。
I'd like something bright. I'm going to Portofino.

840
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,661
波託菲諾！哦，真是命中註定。
Portofino! Oh, it is like fate.

841
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,115
快，把我們爲她留着的那件拿出來。
Quick, the number we have been saving for her.

842
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,828
- Sadaba 女士是通靈的。 - 真的嗎？
- Madame Sadaba is psychic. - Really?

843
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,585
三週前她特意從巴黎訂了這套衣服。
Three weeks ago, she sends all the way to Paris for this suit.

844
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:39,794
爲什麼？因爲她知道你會需要它去波多黎各。
Why? Because she knows you will be needing it for p-Puerto Rico.

845
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,759
Ducky，親愛的，把那個拿出來。
Ducky, darling, bring out the you-know-what.

846
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,640
馬上，陛下。
Right away, majesty.

847
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,768
瞧！
Et voilà

848
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,103
就是它。
here we are.

849
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,984
剛從巴黎下飛機的貨。
Hot off the plane from Paris.

850
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,361
我相信你。它還熱乎着呢。
I believe you. It's still warm.

851
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,943
試穿吧。
Try it on.

852
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,237
- 爲什麼？ - 爲什麼不呢？
- Why? - Why not?

853
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,243
你穿黃色會很好看。
You'd look good in yellow.

854
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,876
Sadaba 不僅通靈，還是個天才。
Sadaba is not only psychic, she's a genius.

855
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,051
看吧，合身得像是爲她量身定做的一樣。
Look, see how it fits. Like it was made for her.

856
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,503
我也有同感。
That's just what I was thinking.

857
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,964
我也是。簡直太美了。
So was I. It's absolutely divine.

858
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,765
就是你了。
It's just you.

859
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,468
是的，就是你。
Yeah. Yeah, it's just you.

860
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,430
謝謝。我真想要它。
Thank you. I'd love to have it.

861
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:37,689
不過再想想，也許 Sadaba 要留着這件給自己。
On second thought, maybe Sadaba keeps this creation for herself.

862
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,896
- 哦。- 哦，拜託，拿下來。
- Oh. - Oh, please take it off.

863
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,402
Sadaba 捨不得把它給出去。
Sadaba cannot bear to part with it.

864
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,336
多少錢？
How much?

865
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:58,130
爲了你，Sadaba 幾乎不賣，
Oh, for you, Sadaba lets it go for practically nothing.

866
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,297
六百美元。
Six hundred dollars.

867
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:03,093
說句公道話，Princess，你真有膽量。
I'll say this for you, Princess, you got a lot of guts.

868
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,637
那是和皇室說話的方式嗎？
Is that the way to talk to royalty?

869
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,967
Ducky，親愛的，上樓把盒子拿來。
Ducky, darling, go upstairs and get the box.

870
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,399
Ducky 會殺了我，但爲了讓你那位小太太高興，
Ducky will kill me, but to make your little wife happy,

871
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,853
這件 Givenchy 給你，價錢 595。
the Givenchy is yours for 595.

872
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,939
那位女士可不是我的妻子。
The lady is not my wife.

873
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,742
Sadaba 絕不會透露半句。
Sadaba will never breathe a word.

874
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:29,195
Sadaba 想怎麼說就怎麼說。
Sadaba can breathe all she wants.

875
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:33,032
我是紐約警察中尉 Bixbee。
I'm lieutenant Bixbee, New York police.

876
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,040
Ducky？
Ducky?

877
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,885
警察來了。
The cops.

878
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,514
呃，我們可沒做什麼違法的事。
Uh, we didn't do nothing illegal.

879
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,435
高價收費並不違法。
There's no law against overcharge.

880
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,854
放輕鬆，陛下。
Just relax, your majesty.

881
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:58,227
沒有人在指控任何人。
Nobody is accusing anybody of anything.

882
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,604
那件套裝是銀行搶劫案的物證。
The suit is evidence in a bank robbery.

883
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,152
報紙上都有報道。
It was in all the papers.

884
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,232
《基督教科學箴言報》上倒沒提到。
It was no mention of it in the Christian science monitor.

885
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,780
它在這裏。
Here it is.

886
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:09,986
穿在你身上會很好看。
It'll look lovely on you.

887
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,412
不，Elcott 太太，我們要把它帶走。
No, Mrs. Elcott, we're taking it.

888
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,036
- 哦？ - 把它包起來，Princess。
- Oh? - Wrap it up, Princess.

889
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,243
給你。大手大腳的花錢者。
Here. Big spender.

890
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,703
七塊錢就白花了。
Seven bucks down the drain.

891
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,255
別緊張。梅里爾·林奇請客。
Relax. Compliments of Merrill lynch.

892
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,425
淨賺三美元。
A whole $3 profit.

893
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,003
非常抱歉。你們的店真漂亮。
I'm terribly sorry. You do have a lovely shop.

894
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,784
有空我想再來。
I'd like to come back when I have more time.

895
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,424
嗯，很榮幸，很榮幸。
Um, pleasure, pleasure.

896
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,143
再見。
Bye.

897
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:45,612
那個名字，那張臉。
That name, that face.

898
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,191
我以前見過她，但在哪兒呢？
I have seen her before, but where?

899
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,776
在哪兒？在哪兒？
Where? Where?

900
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:57,329
Ducky，親愛的，我想我們應該馬上去翻閱
Ducky, precious, I think we go immediately browsing

901
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,035
公共圖書館的《Vogue》舊刊。
through the back issues of vogue

902
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,121
快去。
at the public library. Come on.

903
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:07,088
那女人竟然敢開那種價，真有膽量，不是嗎？
The dame's got a lot of nerve charging those figures, right?

904
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,137
其實，600美元也不是離譜得太遠。
Well, actually, $600 isn't too far out of line.

905
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,635
二手套裝嗎？
For a secondhand suit?

906
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,308
一套二手的 Givenchy 套裝。
A secondhand Givenchy suit.

907
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,102
我不記得 Sadaba 提過 Givenchy 的禮服。
I don't recall Sadaba mentioning a Givenchy suit.

908
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,806
至少在你在場的時候沒聽她提。
At least not while you were there.

909
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,687
- 她沒說？ - 沒有！
- She didn't? -No!

910
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,144
那我又是怎麼知道的呢？
Well, then how did I know?

911
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,946
哦，她確實說過巴黎。
Oh, she did say Paris.

912
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,819
我大概自己聯想起來的。
I must have put two and two together.

913
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,443
是啊。
Yeah.

914
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,403
對，可能就是這樣。
Yeah, that's probably it.

915
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,837
很好。
Very nice.

916
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,927
你知道，我說實話
You know, I was saying that in my line of work

917
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,472
在我這行裏，你不會常來這種地方。
you don't get a chance to spend much time in a joint like this.

918
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:56,996
我覺得這是
You know, I think this is probably

919
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,432
我在紐約最喜歡的地方之一。
my most favorite place in New York.

920
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,810
比你老公的銀行都好，Mrs. Elcott？
Better than your husband's bank, Mrs. Elcott?

921
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,777
怎麼我從 Penelope 又降格爲 Mrs. Elcott 了？
How did I get demoted from Penelope back to Mrs. Elcott?

922
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:09,772
好了。Penelope。
Alright. Penelope.

923
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,070
Penelope，你知道嗎...
Penelope, do you know...

924
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,365
大多數時候我挺喜歡我的工作。
Most of the time I like my job?

925
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,451
- 那是什麼？ - 那個？泡泡糖。
- What's that? - That? It's bubblegum.

926
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,628
- 我可以來一點嗎？ - 好，自己拿吧。
- May I have some? - Yeah, help yourself.

927
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,091
誰是 Ron Swoboda？
Who's Ron Swoboda?

928
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,800
我只是嚼嚼口香糖。
I just chew the gum.

929
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,600
你知道，關於犯罪有件有趣的事。
You know, it's a funny thing about crime.

930
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,847
但通常是無辜的嫌疑人
But it's the innocent suspect

931
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,808
看起來最像罪犯。
that usually looks the most guilty.

932
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,293
因爲他沒什麼可藏的。
That's because he's got nothing to hide.

933
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:45,228
放下了戒備。
Keeps his guard down.

934
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,005
而有罪的人則不停思考。
But the guilty ones, they're always thinking.

935
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,894
他們在注意自己的舉止、聲音、表情。
They're watching themselves pretty good.

936
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,651
最終正是他們的圓滑出賣了他們。
How will they sound and how will that look?

937
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,734
最終，正是他們那種圓滑把他們困住。
And in the end, it's their very smoothness that traps them.

938
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,943
真有意思。
It's fascinating.

939
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,824
你是怎麼做到的？
How do you do that?

940
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:03,875
你小時候是怎樣的？
Now what kind of a childhood did you have?

941
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,668
就是那種戴着牙套的。
The kind with braces on your teeth.

942
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,748
把口香糖攤平，把舌頭塞進去，
Spread the gum flat, poke your tongue into it

943
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,924
把口袋鼓滿空氣。
and fill the pocket with air.

944
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,715
- 我做到了！ - 初學者走運。
- I did it! - Beginner's luck.

945
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:19,388
Penelope，我是我所認識的最棒的警察……
Penelope, I am the best damn cop I know...

946
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,598
而這就是我的麻煩。
And that's my trouble.

947
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,939
我太過能幹，這反而成了我的問題。
I'm too damn good for my own damn good.

948
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,855
我覺得你很棒。
I think you're very good.

949
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:32,484
那位女銀行劫匪很快就會發現這點。
That's what that lady bank robber's about to find out.

950
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,485
你知道的，可憐的孩子沒機會了。
You know, that poor kid doesn't have a chance.

951
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:39,286
- 嗯。 - 自以爲是。
- Mm. -overconfident.

952
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,935
你看，我來自的那個街區裏，
You see, in the neighborhood that I come from

953
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,870
孩子只有三條出路。
a kid had three chances.

954
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,313
可以當混混，可以當警察，
He could be a hood, he could be a cop,

955
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:47,328
也可以當神父。
he could be a priest.

956
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:50,585
我太笨，沒法去偷東西，而且我們又不是天主教徒。
Well, I was too clumsy to steal and we weren't catholic.

957
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,963
要是我有個像樣的街區也許會不一樣。
Maybe if I'd had a neighborhood.

958
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,887
Penelope。怎麼了？
Penelope. What?

959
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,886
你經常去你丈夫的銀行嗎？
Did you spend a lot of time in your husband's bank?

960
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,684
不，能不去我就不去。怎麼了？
No, I hardly ever go there if I can help it. Why?

961
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:03,886
放影片的時候，
When we ran the film

962
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,347
你竟然能那樣立刻說出出納的名字。
you knew the teller's name just like that.

963
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,897
哦，當然我知道她的名字。
Well, of course I knew her name.

964
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,067
它就在櫃檯上的牌子上。
It was on a plaque on the counter.

965
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,393
你沒看到嗎？
Didn't you see it?

966
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,149
唔，我看來並不像
Well, I guess I'm not as good at my job

967
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,151
我以爲的那麼稱職，我沒注意到。
as I thought I was. I missed it.

968
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,903
哦。
Oh.

969
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,325
哦，親愛的。
Oh, dear.

970
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,572
怎麼了？
What's the matter?

971
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,949
我本來十分鐘前該去見 James 的。
I was supposed to meet James ten minutes ago.

972
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,449
那我能留住 Ron Swoboda 嗎？
Do I get to keep Ron Swoboda?

973
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,163
喂，Horatio，看這個。
Hey, Horatio, watch.

974
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,009
不錯吧，嗯？
Not bad, hm?

975
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,420
太棒了。
Terrific.

976
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:43,926
後來 James 在銀行開始升職。
Then James began to get promoted at the bank.

977
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:48,105
第三副總裁，第二副總裁，
Third vice president, second vice president,

978
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,601
第一副總裁。
first vice president.

979
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,651
終於，我們要說到你問題的關鍵了！
At last, we're getting to the crux of your problem!

980
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,694
你看不到嗎？
Don't you see it?

981
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,113
你覺得在你丈夫的生活中被排除在外，
You feel left out of your husband's life

982
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,533
於是你通過補償他對你的冷淡來彌補。
so you compensate for his lack of attention.

983
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:02,953
是嗎？
I do?

984
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:07,245
絕望之下，我開始培養一些愛好。
In desperation, I began taking up hobbies.

985
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,916
首先，是和 James 一起的愛好。
First, hobbies with James.

986
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,244
James！James！
James! James!

987
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,374
事情仍然很不確定。
Things were still pretty much up in the air.

988
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,673
於是我接着嘗試爲 James 而做的愛好。
So I next tried hobbies for James.

989
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,344
James！James！看看我們贏了什麼！
James! James! Look what we won!

990
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,342
乖孩子。
Good girl.

991
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,173
好男孩。
Good boy.

992
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:25,554
好吧，至少他先拍了我一下。
Well, at least he patted me first.

993
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,974
什麼辦法都沒用。
Nothing worked.

994
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,555
有趣的是。
It's funny.

995
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,484
只有一種愛好似乎能讓我高興起來。
There's only one hobby that seemed to cheer me up.

996
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,571
入室盜竊。
Burglary.

997
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,021
不是入室盜竊。那是強行進入。
Not burglary. That's forcible entry.

998
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,027
你犯的只是普通盜竊。
All you committed was simple larceny.

999
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,985
拜託，Gregory，我寧願把它當成入室盜竊來看。
Please, Gregory, I'd rather think of it as burglary.

1000
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,911
那樣更刺激。
It's more exciting.

1001
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,661
Penelope，你入室行竊的受害者有多少？
Penelope, how many victims did you burglarize?

1002
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,208
你挑誰來下手的？
And whom did you choose to burgle?

1003
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,162
呃，偷——偷竊。呃，Rob。
Uh, bur-burglarize. Uh, Rob.

1004
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,588
我不知道。就是些人。
I don't know. Just people.

1005
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,007
是的，人。
Yes, people. People who are your husband's

1006
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,426
就是你丈夫的生意夥伴，對吧？
business associates, huh?

1007
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,719
是的。
Yes.

1008
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:04,594
不知爲什麼，我就是討厭他們。
For some reason, I just hated them.

1009
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,964
無論我和 James 去哪兒，
No matter where James and I went

1010
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,135
都甩不開金融界的那些事。
there was no getting away from the world of finance.

1011
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,874
“總統關於稅收的聲明
"The president's statement on taxes

1012
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,854
給市場帶來了拋售壓力。”
brought selling pressure into the market.

1013
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,382
儘管他確實重申了那點……
And though he did reiterate that...

1014
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,479
哦，我們去遊個泳吧。
Oh, let's go for a little swim.

1015
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,811
呃，好吧……你不覺得現在有點晚了嗎？
Eh, well... don't you think it's late, isn't it?

1016
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,442
哦，拜託。
Oh, come on.

1017
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,819
在紐波特，是 Johanna Keller，
At Newport, it was Johanna Keller,

1018
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,491
她是銀行最大的儲戶之一。
one of the bank's biggest depositors.

1019
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,239
- 我最後吃的那根熱狗…… - 哦，拜託。
- The last hot dog I ate... - Oh, come on.

1020
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,911
哦，求你了，小姐……
Oh, please, miss...

1021
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,807
從那以後，我們就不怎麼見到 Keller 小姐了。
After that, we didn't see so much of miss Keller.

1022
01:00:54,898 --> 01:00:58,735
即便我們去跳舞，比如街區那晚，
Even when we'd go dancing, like the night at the block,

1023
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,528
遲早，James 的銀行界朋友們
sooner or later, James' banking friends

1024
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,822
會破壞我們的樂趣。
would manage to spoil our fun.

1025
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,868
哦，遲早我得和他們談生意了。
Oh, sooner or later, I'm going to have to talk business with them.

1026
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,161
我不明白爲什麼。
I don't see why.

1027
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,705
畢竟，你又不是在銀行裏和他們跳舞，對吧？
After all, you don't dance with them at the bank, do you?

1028
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,579
親愛的，我愛你。
I love you, darling.

1029
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,252
我很慶幸不必和你談生意。
I'm glad I don't have to do business with you.

1030
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,876
真不公平，你們倆。
Not fair, you two.

1031
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,878
哦，那是“la Bostella”。
Oh, it's "la Bostella."

1032
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,880
你就不能死嗎？
Couldn't you just die?

1033
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,553
音樂一停，我們就都倒下。
When the music stops, we all fall down.

1034
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,983
我就得收拾他一下。
I just had to fix him.

1035
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,614
不錯。
Not bad.

1036
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,416
鑽石王冠，三枚胸針，
Diamond tiara, three brooches,

1037
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,836
九條手鐲和一條掛式項鍊。
nine bracelets and a lavaliere.

1038
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,006
哦，我最精彩的一次是我拿走了……
Oh, and my best caper was when I took...

1039
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,216
Penny，別說了。別說了。
Penny, just stop. Just stop.

1040
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:05,794
但那還遠遠不止這些。
我可以講好幾個小時。
But there's lots more. I could go on for hours.

1041
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,175
也許你可以，但我可做不到。
Maybe you could, but I couldn't.

1042
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,099
Gregory，你千萬別因此沮喪。
Gregory, you mustn't let this depress you.

1043
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,643
沮喪是一種奢侈，
Depression is a luxury

1044
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,187
經驗豐富的精神科醫生是不能沉溺其中的。
not permitted the experienced psychiatrist.

1045
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,559
嗯，那很好。
Well, that's good.

1046
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:19,651
因爲這件事也有積極的一面。
Because there is a bright side to this whole thing.

1047
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,274
按我那時婚姻的走向來看，
Well, the way my marriage was headed

1048
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,856
以及我那時的神經狀態，
and the state of nerves I was in,

1049
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,657
要不是有竊盜癖在，我
if it hadn't been for kleptomania

1050
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,655
可能真會有點兒精神失常。
I might have gone a little kook.

1051
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,873
Penny，你知道當你的分析師有多難嗎？
Penny, do you have any idea how difficult

1052
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,496
你知道嗎，做你的分析師可不容易。
it is being your analyst?

1053
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,372
哦，Gregory，你應該在認識我之前就見過我，
Oh, Gregory, you should have known me

1054
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,999
那時候的我
in the days before you knew me.

1055
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,331
很模糊、很輕浮。
I was vague, frivolous.

1056
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,381
你甚至可以說我有點兒神經質。
You might even say a bit of a ding.

1057
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,960
謝天謝地，我已經安定下來了。再見。
Thank heaven, I've settled down. Bye.

1058
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,598
你認爲忘鞋子意味着什麼呢？
What do you suppose it means

1059
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,898
當你老是忘記鞋子時，這意味着什麼？嗯。
when you keep forgetting your shoes? Hm.

1060
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,963
你要急到哪裏去？你還有七分鐘。
Where are you rushing to? You still have seven minutes left.

1061
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,444
哦，你可以記在賬上。我得去 Park Lane 畫廊了。
Oh, you can owe me. I'm off to the park Lane galleries.

1062
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,613
那裏有一幅倫勃朗，簡直是撿便宜。
There's a Rembrandt there that's a steal.

1063
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,032
倫勃朗。Penny，你不會真的去偷吧。
A Rembrandt. Penny, you wouldn't.

1064
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,157
出租車！出租車！
Taxi! Taxi!

1065
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,192
噓。
Psst.

1066
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,948
噓。
Psst.

1067
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,039
Gregory。噓！
Gregory. Shh!

1068
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:56,408
什麼？警察來了。
What? Police.

1069
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,700
他們可能跟蹤我來了。警察？
They may have followed me. Police?

1070
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,832
Gregory，你到底做了什麼？
Gregory, what have you done?

1071
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,788
什麼都沒做。我什麼都沒做。
Nothing. I haven't done anything.

1072
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:07,987
好吧，如果你什麼都沒做，
Well, if you haven't done anything

1073
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,071
那警察爲什麼會——
then why would the police...

1074
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:13,259
Penelope，我現在不想爭論。現在告訴我，你把錢藏在哪兒了？
Penelope, I don't want to get into a discussion, not now.

1075
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,683
現在告訴我，你把錢藏在哪兒了？
Now tell me, where, where did you hide the money?

1076
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:17,770
什麼錢？
What money?

1077
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,765
你說“什麼錢”是什麼意思？你知道的……
What do you mean, what money? You know what...

1078
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,022
贓款。那筆贓款。
Loot. The loot.

1079
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,940
哦，那個錢。
Oh, that money.

1080
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:28,737
說實話，那事讓我很擔心。
Well, frankly, that's had me very worried.

1081
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,360
我的意思是，我不能就把它隨便放在某個地方。
I mean, I couldn't just leave it lying around any place.

1082
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,284
你知道的，那樣很不安全。
You know, that could be very dodgy.

1083
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:36,282
我一直隨身帶着……哦！
I carry it with... oh!

1084
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,377
你們的中尉 Bixbee 知道了。
Your lieutenant Bixbee, he knows.

1085
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:49,583
他剛來見過我。
He just came to see me.

1086
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:52,293
我覺得他昨天舉止有些奇怪。
I thought he acted strangely yesterday.

1087
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,925
奇怪？怎麼奇怪？
Strangely how?

1088
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,678
我也說不上來。有點……內疚的樣子。
I don't know. Sort of... guilty.

1089
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,135
他爲什麼會覺得內疚？哦，算了。噢！
Why would he feel guilty? Oh, never mind. Ooh!

1090
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:05,859
Penny，聽我說。
Penny, listen to me.

1091
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,671
你必須今天就把那筆錢送回銀行。
You've got to get that money back to the bank today.

1092
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,560
現在。怎麼做？
Now. How?

1093
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,271
我不能就走進去把錢交上去。
I can't just walk in and hand it over.

1094
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,776
嗯，我想過……
Well, I figured that...

1095
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,982
哦，把錢給我吧，
Oh, give me the money

1096
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,284
我會把它放進夜間存款口。
and I'll, I'll stick it in the night deposit chute.

1097
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:19,113
哦，Gregory，我不想你牽扯進來。
Oh, Gregory, I don't like to see you get involved.

1098
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,868
我也不想。
Neither do I.

1099
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,870
來吧，把所有的都給我。
Come on. All of it.

1100
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,171
哦，Penny。
Oh, penny.

1101
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,765
Penny.
Penny.

1102
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,472
- 好了，我看起來如何？
- 看起來很害怕。
- Alright, how do I look? - Frightened.

1103
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,808
哦，不，我是說頭部這兒。
Oh, no, I mean up here.

1104
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,733
- 像蝙蝠俠。 - 謝謝。
- Like Batman. - Thanks.

1105
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,812
Gregory，你真體貼。
Gregory, you're very sweet.

1106
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,942
但你爲什麼非要這麼做不可？
But why do you insist on doing this?

1107
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,819
因爲我愛你。
Because I'm in love with you.

1108
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,696
因爲我對你癡狂。 - Gregory.
- Because I'm crazy about you. - Gregory.

1109
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,529
當我說癡狂時，我是醫學上說的那種。
And when I say crazy, I'm using the word medically.

1110
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,143
- 但就在前幾天…… - 算了。
- But just the other day... - Forget it.

1111
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:04,624
- 你說了…… - 算了，算了！
- You said... - Forget it. Forget it!

1112
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:09,421
現在我們走吧，儘量表現得很自然。
Now let's get out of here and try to act very natural.

1113
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:27,601
- 他們把我們鎖起來了！ - 別擔心。
- They locked us in! - Don't worry.

1114
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:28,919
那鈴鐺應該會有人來。
That bell ought to bring somebody.

1115
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,855
那鈴鐺會把所有人都引來。那是盜賊警報。
That bell will bring everybody. That's a burglar alarm.

1116
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,857
- 要是他們搜我們怎麼辦？ - 那又怎樣？
- What if they search us? - Well, what of it?

1117
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,010
- 我們沒有偷東西。 - 今天沒偷東西。
- We haven't stolen anything. - Not today, we haven't.

1118
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,194
你以爲這是什麼地方？
What do you think this is?

1119
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:39,742
- 哦，Penny。 - 他們不敢搜我們。
- Oh, penny. - They wouldn't dare search us.

1120
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,741
喂喂，有人在嗎？喂！
Yoo-hoo, somebody! Yoo-hoo!

1121
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,322
還不行！還不行！
Not yet! Not yet!

1122
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,282
喂！喂！
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

1123
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,083
晚上好。你介意開門嗎？
Good evening. Would you mind opening the gate, please?

1124
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:53,335
你們在裏面，幹什麼呢？
You in there, what are you up to?

1125
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,962
什麼也沒幹。我發誓。
Nothing. I swear it.

1126
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:56,964
請叫經理來。
Please call the manager.

1127
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,384
我就是經理。
I am the manager.

1128
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,841
關門時你們藏在哪裏了？
Where were you hiding when we locked up?

1129
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,722
哦，就在那個櫥櫃後面。
Oh, right behind that cabinet.

1130
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:05,956
不，我們沒有。我們沒藏。
No, we weren't. We weren't hiding.

1131
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,345
我們站着，我們站着。
We were standing. We were standing.

1132
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,726
你們不知道我們已經關門了嗎？
Don't you realize we're closed?

1133
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,227
那正是問題所在。
Well, that's just the trouble.

1134
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,901
如果你們開門，我們就能離開。
If you were open, we could leave.

1135
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,149
別你們敢搜我們的身
And don't you dare try to search us

1136
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,526
否則我們就報警。
or we'll call the police.

1137
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:19,824
Penelope！她不是那個意思。
Penelope! She didn't mean that.

1138
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,822
你不是那個意思。
You didn't mean that.

1139
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,282
你算什麼，女士？有毛病嗎？
What are you, lady? Some kind of a nut?

1140
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,492
我不喜歡你的態度。
I don't care for your attitude.

1141
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:29,980
順便說一句，你見到
And for your information, you have seen

1142
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,416
我這種人，這就是最後一次了。
the last of me in this gallery.

1143
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,997
走吧，Gregory。
Come, Gregory.

1144
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,074
早安，親愛的。喂。是的。
Morning, darling. Hello. Yeah.

1145
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,367
嗯。
Yeah.

1146
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:46,903
是的。
Yes.

1147
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,489
什麼？你確定嗎？
What? You sure?

1148
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:51,540
是的，我——真難相信。
Yeah, I-I find that hard to believe.

1149
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,502
半小時後。
In, uh, half an hour.

1150
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,625
好。
Right.

1151
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,628
剛纔電話是誰的？
Who was that on the phone?

1152
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,300
是銀行打來的。
The bank.

1153
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:04,254
哦，他們想要什麼？
Oh, what'd they want?

1154
01:09:04,349 --> 01:09:06,089
誰想要什麼？
What did who want?

1155
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:07,515
銀行。
The bank.

1156
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,342
他們想和我談。
They wanted to talk to me.

1157
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,553
- 關於什麼 - 關於銀行業的事。
- Well, what about? - About banking.

1158
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:13,982
哦。
Oh.

1159
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,865
好吧，他們把金融版放哪兒了？
Well, where did they hide the financial section?

1160
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,693
你什麼時候開始關心錢的事了？
Since when have you been concerned with money matters?

1161
01:09:26,788 --> 01:09:29,029
我只是表示一點做妻子的關心。
I'm just showing a little wifely interest.

1162
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,913
嗯，那真好笑。金融版嗎？
Well, that's funny. The financial section?

1163
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,798
不，我只是希望……
No, I was just hoping...

1164
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,216
- 早上好，Toshi。 - 早
- Morning, Toshi. - Morning.

1165
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:43,759
我只是想也許會有
I just thought maybe there might be

1166
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,115
關於那起搶劫案的一些好消息。
some good news about the robbery.

1167
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,004
壞消息怎麼會有好消息？
How can there be good news about bad news?

1168
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,558
嗯，有可能。你可能能把錢要回來。
Well, it's possible. You could get the money back.

1169
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:52,306
那不會在財經版出現。
That wouldn't be in the financial section.

1170
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,888
會登在宗教版的“奇蹟”欄目。
It would be on the religious page under miracles.

1171
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:57,564
不過，你已經拿回那1000美元了。
Well, you already got that $1000 back.

1172
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,296
希望我別用同樣的方式把其餘的錢也拿回來。
Let's hope I don't get the rest back the same way.

1173
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,436
我可能會破產。
I could go broke.

1174
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:04,568
James，你還是不明白那件事，不是嗎...
James, you still don't understand about that, do you...

1175
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:05,899
現在我明白了，我明白了，我明白了。
Now I do, I do, I do.

1176
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,304
好了，拜託，別再解釋了。
Now, please, don't explain it again.

1177
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,865
我收支相抵了，我很高興，我欣喜若狂，是吧？
I broke even, I'm delighted, I'm delirious, huh?

1178
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:14,995
嗯，你確實是收支平衡了。嗯。
Well, you did break even. Mm.

1179
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,372
Mannix 醫生說你只是固執罷了。
Dr. Mannix says you're just being stubborn.

1180
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,048
哦，Mannix 醫生這麼說的？
Oh, Dr. Mannix says that, does he?

1181
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,296
是的，他說了。
Yes, he does.

1182
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:27,003
Mannix 醫生怎麼會知道這事？
How does Dr. Mannix know anything about it?

1183
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,804
嗯，因爲我告訴了他。
Well, I told him.

1184
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,350
我告訴他一切。
I tell him everything.

1185
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,143
什麼？一切？
What do you mean, everything?

1186
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:36,513
一切。
Everything.

1187
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,268
關於我也告訴了嗎？
About me too?

1188
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,020
當然。
Well, of course.

1189
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,648
我想我會去和你的 Mannix 醫生談談。
I think I'll have a talk with your Dr. Mannix.

1190
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,355
James，那太好了。
James, that's marvelous.

1191
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,657
你無法想象他能幫到你多少。
You have no idea how much he could help you.

1192
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,450
我不想要幫助。
I don't want help.

1193
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:51,073
那爲何要浪費錢？
Well, then why waste the money?

1194
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,075
Bixbee 中尉。
Lieutenant Bixbee.

1195
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,955
你們的錢...
Your money...

1196
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:00,161
我們都找回來了。
We got it all back.

1197
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,256
我就知道。
I knew it.

1198
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,046
看來我低估你了，Bixbee。
Seems I underestimated you, Bixbee.

1199
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:05,112
我想請你去局裏一趟。
I thought maybe you'd like to go down to headquarters.

1200
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,469
你看，我們也抓到了偷錢的那個女孩。
You see, we also got the girl who stole it.

1201
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,547
我們現在要把她帶去審問。
We're bringing her up for questioning now.

1202
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,682
Toshi，我的帽子！
Toshi, my hat!

1203
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,259
我不明白。
I don't understand.

1204
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,140
嗯，你知道嗎，這事也讓我有些意外。
Well, you know, it kind of took me by surprise too.

1205
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,064
我以爲我把案子想透了。
I thought I had this case all figured out.

1206
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,062
- 準備好。- 好了，中尉。
- Goes to show you. - Ready, lieutenant.

1207
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,060
等一下，James，我要跟你一起去。
Wait a minute. James, I'll go with you.

1208
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:26,508
不，不，親愛的，你沒必要捲進這件事。
No, no, darling, there's no need for you to be involved in this.

1209
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,488
等我！等我！
Wait for me! Wait for me!

1210
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:37,495
Horatio，如果你們逮錯人怎麼辦？
Horatio, what if you've arrested the wrong girl?

1211
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,585
絕無可能。
Not a chance.

1212
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,206
我們抓她的時候，她身上就有那筆錢。
She had the money on her when we picked her up.

1213
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,583
好吧。往這邊來。
Alright. Right this way.

1214
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,882
哦，嗨，寶貝。
Oh, hi, doll.

1215
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,884
你是新來的嗎，不是嗎？
Well, you're new in here, aren't you?

1216
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,787
我是說，我不記得在夜間法庭見過你。
I mean, I don't recall making your acquaintance

1217
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,642
in night court or nothin'.

1218
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,972
我叫 Honeysuckle Rose。
Mine's honeysuckle Rose.

1219
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,890
看起來你過得不錯。
You must be doing pretty good.

1220
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,850
那件看起來差點像是真的貂皮。
That almost looks like for-real mink.

1221
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,653
好了，Rose小姐。別動，放鬆一下。
Alright, miss Rose. Just hold it. Relax a minute.

1222
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,571
不是冒犯您，Elcott太太。
No offense, Mrs. Elcott.

1223
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,947
那穿真貂皮的女士是這位先生的太太，
The lady in the genuine mink is the wife of this gentleman,

1224
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,870
正好是你們被搶的那家銀行的行長。
who happens to be the president of the bank that you hit.

1225
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,493
哦。
Oh.

1226
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,787
她看起來確實有點像…
Well, she looks pretty enough to be...

1227
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,243
你真名叫什麼，親愛的？
What's your right name, honey?

1228
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,750
我不是跟你說了嗎，Honeysuckle Rose。
Well, I told you. Honeysuckle Rose.

1229
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,832
我姐姐叫 Mexicali Rose。
My sister's Mexicali Rose.

1230
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,793
我知道，都是 Washington Square 的那些“玫瑰”。
I know, the roses of Washington square.

1231
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,468
Huntington，West Virginia。
Huntington, West Virginia.

1232
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,763
我們曾經開車經過那裏，James，還記得嗎？
We drove through there once, James, remember?

1233
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,702
Penelope，拜託。我們能繼續了嗎？
Penelope, please. Can't we get on with this, hm?

1234
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,637
Honeysuckle，你能不能做個乖孩子
Honeysuckle, why don't you be a good girl

1235
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,764
好好把話說清楚，坦白承認？
and just give us a full confession?

1236
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,769
嗯，好吧。
Hm, okay.

1237
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,944
呃，我昨晚在 Park Avenue 遛貓
Um, I was walking my cat up park Avenue

1238
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,986
大約，呃，凌晨三點左右
around, uh, 3 o'clock this morning

1239
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:54,818
我看到那東西幾乎就躺在人行道上。
when I see that lying on the sidewalk... practically.

1240
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,868
更正一下。你是走進了我的銀行
Correction. You walked into my bank

1241
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,141
大約下午3點左右
around 3 o'clock in the afternoon

1242
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,076
兩天前，偷走了那筆錢。
two days ago and stole the money.

1243
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,953
等會兒。
Now wait a minute.

1244
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,956
我看起來像會搶銀行的人嗎？
Do I look like a person who'd stick up a bank?

1245
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,207
當然不是。
Of course not.

1246
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,587
哎呦，凌晨三點遛貓有什麼不對嗎？
Oh, come now, walking a cat at 3 o'clock in the morning?

1247
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,633
我看不出有什麼不對。
I don't see anything wrong with that.

1248
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,461
她可能做的是夜班工作。
She probably does night work.

1249
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:15,842
- 你是嗎？ - 嗯，呃……
- Do you? - Well, uh...

1250
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,178
是的。
Yeah.

1251
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,055
看吧？
You see?

1252
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,228
好吧，事情總算定下來了。
Well, I'm glad we got that decided.

1253
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:25,807
Penelope，我覺得你並沒有看清全貌。
Penelope, I don't think you're getting the full picture.

1254
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:29,065
你看，對 Rose 小姐的指控
You see, the charge against miss Rose here

1255
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,272
不是遛貓，而是搶銀行。
is not cat-walking, it's bank-robbing.

1256
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:34,072
這是陷害。
Well, it's a frame.

1257
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,243
我發誓我從沒進過那家銀行。
I never set foot inside that bank, I swear it.

1258
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,911
我相信你。
I believe you.

1259
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:42,410
但他們不信。
Well, but they don't.

1260
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,867
看看他們的表情！
Well, look at their faces!

1261
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,294
哦，這可不是30天服刑就完事的案子。
Oh, this is no 30 days and out rap.

1262
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,214
他們要把我關起來，扔掉鑰匙。
They-they wanna lock me up and throw away the key.

1263
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:53,714
親愛的，相信我，你堅持這個荒謬的說法只會讓自己更難受
Honey, believe me, you're only making it tough on yourself

1264
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,795
一直堅持這種荒唐的故事。
by sticking to this cockamamie story.

1265
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,256
那是我唯一會編的荒誕故事！
Well, that's the only cockamamie story I know!

1266
01:13:58,351 --> 01:13:59,786
好了，女管理員，把她帶出去。
Alright, matron, get her out of here.

1267
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:02,176
哦，不，等等。
Oh, no. No, wait.

1268
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:04,478
等等，我…我承認。
Wait, I-I-l admit it.

1269
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,726
我撒謊了。
Lied.

1270
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,274
那錢並不是放在路邊的。
The-the money w-wasn't on the sidewalk.

1271
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:12,229
是從存款口裏露出來的。
I-it was sticking out of the deposit slot.

1272
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:16,066
本來我是要把它送回去的，或許還能拿點賞金。
Well, I was gonna return it. Maybe collect a reward even.

1273
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,071
但那不會讓我成了搶銀行的壞人，對吧？
But that doesn't make me a bank robber, does it?

1274
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,744
我是說，不是他們所說的那種意思。
I mean, not-not like they mean.

1275
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:23,368
等等，等等。
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1276
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,324
你們犯了個可怕的錯誤。
You're making a terrible mistake.

1277
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:27,080
親愛的，他們知道自己在做什麼。
Honey, they know what they're doing.

1278
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,503
那你怎麼知道她沒有說實話？
Well, how do you know that she isn't telling the truth?

1279
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,548
這是我的推測。事情完全可能按她說的那樣發生過。
It's my theory. It could have happened exactly as she said it.

1280
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,672
你是說有人真的把59,000美元
You mean somebody actually left $59,000

1281
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:38,470
在深夜放在銀行門口？
on the doorstep of a bank in the middle of the night?

1282
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,718
- 是的！ - 誰，Elcott太太？
- Yes! - Who, Mrs. Elcott?

1283
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:44,264
小偷，就是那人。搶銀行的那位。
The thief, that's who. The bank robber.

1284
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,095
親愛的，出於什麼理由呢？
For what possible reason, darling?

1285
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,647
因爲她想擺脫那筆錢。
Because she was trying to get rid of it.

1286
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,443
在她從中偷走錢的同一家銀行裏？
In the same bank that she stole it from?

1287
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:54,191
當然。
Certainly.

1288
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:57,023
你看，她從來就不想要那錢。
You see, she never wanted the money in the first place.

1289
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,860
- 她之所以拿走是因爲... - 爲什麼？
- She only took it because... - Because why?

1290
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,529
因爲她控制不了自己。
Because she couldn't help herself.

1291
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:05,364
呃，Elcott太太，我們感謝你的幫助，
Uh, we appreciate your help, Mrs. Elcott,

1292
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,451
但你的理論是出於對嫌疑人的同情，
but your theory is based on sympathy for the suspect,

1293
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:09,546
而不是事實。
not fact.

1294
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,120
好了，女管理員。
Okay, matron.

1295
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,580
不！
No!

1296
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,585
好吧。
Alright.

1297
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:18,044
你們想要供詞，我會確保你們得到一個。
You wanted a confession and I'll see that you get one.

1298
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,801
非常感謝，但 Rose小姐不願意說話。
Thanks a lot, but miss Rose is not talking.

1299
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:23,803
不是從 Rose小姐那裏，是從真正的搶劫犯那裏。
No, not from miss Rose, from the bank robber.

1300
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,680
就是那個搶你們銀行的女人
From the woman who robbed your bank

1301
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,683
戴着紅色假髮、穿黃色套裝逃走的那位。
and escaped in a red wig and a yellow suit.

1302
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,889
我。
Me.

1303
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,650
對不起，James。
I'm sorry, James.

1304
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,821
改天我再解釋爲什麼非得選你們的銀行。
I'll just have to explain later why it had to be your bank.

1305
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,772
但現在最重要的是
But right now, the most important thing

1306
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,108
揪出事實真相
is to get to the truth of this

1307
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,909
這樣這個可憐的無辜女孩就不必入獄。
so that this poor innocent girl doesn't have to go to jail.

1308
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,790
所以請叫個速記員來吧，
So if you will call a stenographer

1309
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,146
我會口述一份完整的陳述。
I will dictate a full statement.

1310
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,582
現在，Elcott太太，我擔心你有些緊張過度。
Now, Mrs. Elcott, I'm afraid you're under a strain.

1311
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:52,899
或許你最好把她送回家。
Perhaps you better take her home.

1312
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,629
你知道，打個盹什麼的。
You know, a nap or somethin'.

1313
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,552
你們不相信我嗎？
Why, you don't believe me.

1314
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,387
你們任何人都不相信。
None of you.

1315
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,925
當真相就擺在你面前時，你們都看不出來。
You don't recognize the truth when it slaps you in the face.

1316
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:11,263
你覺得我瘋了嗎，不是嗎？
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

1317
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,848
哦，不，當然不是。不是。
Oh, no, certainly not. No.

1318
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,150
呃，你知道，有時候，呃……
Uh, you know, sometimes, uh...

1319
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,102
嗯，我們有時都需要幫助。
Well, we all need help sometimes.

1320
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,198
嗯，我並不處於緊張狀態。
Well, I am not under a strain.

1321
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,116
至於我的頭腦，從來沒有
And as far as my head, it has never been

1322
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,535
像此刻這般清晰。
clearer than at this moment.

1323
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,362
至於我是否需要幫助，
And as far as my needing help is concerned,

1324
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:29,870
讓我向你保證：我每週都見精神科醫生五次。
let me assure you that I see my psychiatrist five times a week.

1325
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,876
女管理員。
Matron.

1326
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,125
對不起，Rose小姐。
I'm sorry, miss Rose.

1327
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:37,878
但別擔心，他們不會關你太久。
But don't worry, they can't keep you long.

1328
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,175
我會讓他們相信我。我向你保證。
I'll make them believe me. I promise you.

1329
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,672
謝謝。
Thank you.

1330
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:43,925
但是——你知道嗎，Elcott太太，
But-but you know something, Mrs. Elcott,

1331
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,972
呃——這真可惜，
a-and it's a shame,

1332
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,513
就連我也不相信你。
even I don't believe you.

1333
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,737
我可憐的寶貝。
My poor darling.

1334
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,441
哦，James，我真失望。
Oh, I'm so disappointed in you, James.

1335
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,276
你爲什麼不相信我？
Why won't you believe me?

1336
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,987
相信你是竊盜癖患者？小偷？銀行劫匪？
Believe you're a kleptomaniac? A thief? A bank robber?

1337
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,868
親愛的，你會那樣看我嗎？
Darling, would you believe that of me?

1338
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:10,959
當然會。
Of course.

1339
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:12,749
如果你真心想讓我相信你是小偷，我會相信的。
If you really and truly wanted me

1340
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,748
to believe that you were a thief, I would.

1341
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:17,171
- 因爲我信任你。 - 我怎麼能相信你？
- Because I trust you. - How can I believe you?

1342
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:18,318
昨晚三點鐘
Last night at 3:00 in the morning

1343
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,923
你還躺在我身旁。
you were in bed next to me.

1344
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,501
那又有什麼問題？我們是夫妻。
Well, what's wrong with that? We're married.

1345
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:25,008
嗯，但——那筆錢，親愛的。
Uh, but-but the money, darling.

1346
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,635
哦，那件事。
Oh, that.

1347
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,932
Gregory 替我把錢放回去了。
Gregory took it back for me.

1348
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,351
我得說他做得並不怎麼好。
I must say he didn't do a very good job of it.

1349
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:32,999
他並沒有在幫助你這件事上做得很好
He's not doing a very good job of helping you

1350
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:35,685
通過遷就你這些幻想。
by humoring these fantasies of yours.

1351
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:38,313
你知道 Gregory 爲什麼說我搶了你們銀行嗎？
Do you know why Gregory says I robbed your bank?

1352
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:41,020
因爲你把更多注意力放在銀行上，而不是我身上。
Because you pay more attention to it than you do to me.

1353
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,322
你幾乎都不再注意我了。
You hardly ever even notice me anymore.

1354
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,947
我知道。我能做什麼？告訴我你想要什麼。
You know I do. What do you want? Tell me what you want.

1355
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:49,403
任何事，任何你想要的，親愛的。
Anything, anything you want, darling.

1356
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,038
好吧，真正讓我在意的只有一件事。
Well, there's only one thing I really care about.

1357
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:57,787
那件事對我很重要。
Something that would mean a great deal to me.

1358
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:58,962
說吧。
Name it.

1359
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,710
我想舉辦一個體面的雞尾酒會
I'd like to give a nice cocktail party

1360
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,291
爲你所有的朋友舉行。
for all of your friends.

1361
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,047
一個雞尾酒會。
A cocktail party.

1362
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,014
你要不要讓司機把你放在銀行門口？
Should you tell the driver to drop you off at the bank?

1363
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,466
穿這身？
In this?

1364
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,667
她在家嗎？Elcott 太太？
She's home? Mrs. Elcott?

1365
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,915
請問誰打來？
Who is calling, please?

1366
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,879
朋友。
Friends.

1367
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,340
匿名的。
Anonymous.

1368
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,424
匿名先生和太太。
Mr. and Mrs. anonymous.

1369
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:50,715
你好。
Hello.

1370
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,176
- 你記得 Sadaba 嗎？ - 還有 Ducky？
- You remember Sadaba? - And ducky?

1371
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:55,727
當然記得。
Of course.

1372
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,099
請坐，Elcott 太太。
Have a seat, Mrs. Elcott.

1373
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,610
我有什麼能爲你效勞的嗎？
Is there something I can do for you?

1374
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:07,155
- 爲我們？不。 - 我們要爲你做點事。
- For us? No. - We do something for you.

1375
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,450
哦，我在等客人。
Oh, well, I'm expecting guests.

1376
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,447
呃，如果你們是來賣衣服的...
Uh, if you're here to sell me a dress...

1377
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,199
重要得多，不只是件衣服。
Much more important than a dress.

1378
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,906
我們來賣給你自由。
We come to sell you freedom.

1379
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:19,702
哦！那真是個了不起的事業。
Oh! Oh, well, that's a wonderful cause.

1380
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,583
我一直對自由很感興趣。
I'm always interested in freedom.

1381
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:24,131
- 爲所有人。 - 尤其是爲你。
- For everybody. - Especially for you.

1382
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,714
現在說說錢。
The check now.

1383
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:30,220
你想要多少？
How much would you like?

1384
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,922
25000 美元。
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

1385
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,053
要這麼多？
As much as that?

1386
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:37,181
那是用來幹什麼的？
Well, what, uh, is it for?

1387
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,855
爲了讓一位好女士不進監獄。
To keep a nice lady out of jail.

1388
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:45,482
Sadaba 知道 Mrs. James Elcott 搶了她丈夫的銀行。
Sadaba knows Mrs. James Elcott robbed her husband's bank.

1389
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,905
你知道這事？
You know that?

1390
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:55,078
真的？你確定嗎？
Really? Are you positive?

1391
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,156
你沒剛剛聽見她自己承認嗎？
You didn't hear her just tell you?

1392
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,450
你能證明嗎？
Can you prove it?

1393
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,878
Sadaba 是傻瓜嗎？
Is Sadaba a fool?

1394
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,456
她當場就證明了。怎麼證明？
Certainly she proves it. How?

1395
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:12,180
這是兩年前雜誌上的一張照片。
Here is a picture from magazine two years old.

1396
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,931
你認出這位女士了嗎？
You recognize the lady?

1397
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:17,431
- 是我！- 哦，別靠那麼近。
- It's me! - Oh, not so close.

1398
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:21,184
Ducky，親愛的，讀上面的字。
Ducky, sweetheart, read the words.

1399
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,312
“在慈善午宴上，紐約的 Mrs. James Elcott
"At luncheon for charity, Mrs. James Elcott of New York

1400
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:29,067
身着 Givenchy 設計的黃色羊毛套裝。”
wearing a suit of yellow wool designed by Givenchy."

1401
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,649
那就是穿黃色套裝的我！
It's me in the yellow suit!

1402
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:34,030
如果有人看到了那...
Well, if anybody saw that...

1403
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,664
你們在勒索我！
You're blackmailing me!

1404
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:40,908
勒索是刑事犯罪。
Blackmail is a criminal offense.

1405
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,743
我們的目的是
What we're trying to do

1406
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,877
做一件價值 25000 美元的好事。
is a $25,000 good turn.

1407
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,377
哦。
Oh.

1408
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:51,302
如果我不付呢？
And suppose I won't pay it?

1409
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,131
那你會付的，否則我們就把照片給你丈夫看。
But you will, or we show this to your husband.

1410
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:57,971
哦，我能指望你們這麼做嗎？
Oh, can I depend on that?

1411
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,511
算是我的承諾。
Here is my word.

1412
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:03,643
她說的“指望”是什麼意思？
What does she mean, depend on it?

1413
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,942
哦，他隨時會來。
Oh, he ought to be along any minute.

1414
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,314
你能等嗎？
Can you wait?

1415
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:12,648
也許丈夫也牽涉其中，是吧？
So maybe the husband is in the game, huh?

1416
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:15,906
那我們甚至可以不用給他看？
So maybe we don't even bother to show him?

1417
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,078
哦，你們一定要的，拜託。
Oh, you've got to, please.

1418
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,406
我們沒有......
We don't got...

1419
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:23,083
但也許我們應該把照片拿去給警察。
But maybe we take the picture to the police.

1420
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,286
立刻。快點。
Right away. Quick.

1421
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,372
你覺得怎麼樣？
What do you say to that?

1422
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:29,297
好，我-我就跟你們去。
Okay, I-I'll go with you.

1423
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,591
不。
No.

1424
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:34,340
Ducky，這地方讓我覺得有點可疑。
Ducky, something is smelling crooked in the place.

1425
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,423
- 出去。 - 不！哦，等等！拜託，聽我說！
- Out. - No! Oh, wait! Please, listen!

1426
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,930
- 我們把證據處理掉！- 停下！你們在幹什麼？
- We get rid of the evidence! - Stop! What are you doing?

1427
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,931
拜託，你們把一切都毀了！
Please, you're spoiling everything!

1428
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,308
我們把證據吞了！吞下去！
We swallow the evidence! Swallow!

1429
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,732
James，哦，親愛的。
James, oh, darling.

1430
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,275
幸好你來了。
Thank heaven you're here.

1431
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:52,401
親愛的，這是 Princess Sadaba 和 Ducky。
Darling, this is Princess Sadaba and Ducky.

1432
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,699
他們來這裏是想勒索我。
And they came here to blackmail me.

1433
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:59,620
Princess Sadaba，現在請向我丈夫解釋
Princess Sadaba, now please explain to my husband

1434
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:02,072
爲什麼你要勒索我。
why you're blackmailing me.

1435
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:06,665
我們是來給你太太看晚禮服的。
We came to interest your wife in an evening gown.

1436
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,872
突然之間，居然有人跟我說起
Out of the blue, suddenly I'm hearing

1437
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,548
呃，勒索的事。
uh, about blackmail.

1438
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,500
James, 那不是真的
James, that's not true.

1439
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,961
他們有確鑿的證據說我搶了你們的銀行。
They have positive proof that I robbed your bank.

1440
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,056
什麼銀行？
What bank?

1441
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,972
Mr. Elcott，很抱歉這麼說，
Mr. Elcott, I hate to say this,

1442
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,641
但你娶了個有點古怪的女人。
but you are married to some wacky woman.

1443
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:24,344
我妻子最近一直覺得不太好。
My wife has not been feeling too well lately.

1444
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,058
James，你要相信他們還是相信我？
James, are you going to believe them or me?

1445
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:29,983
親愛的，你又在幻想了。
Honey, you're imagining things again.

1446
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,312
幻想？幻想？
Imagining things? Imagining things?

1447
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,114
好吧，問他他在吃什麼。
Alright, ask him what he's eating.

1448
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,986
打擾一下，先生，你在吃什麼？
Excuse me, sir, what are you eating?

1449
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:44,073
- 我吃得晚了。 - 謝謝。
- I had a late lunch. - Thank you.

1450
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,076
哦！
Oh!

1451
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,126
來吧，殿下。
Come, highness.

1452
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,592
對不起。
I'm sorry.

1453
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,761
如果我能彌補什麼的話……
If there's any way I can make amends...

1454
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,010
你有沒有氣泡水之類的？
You got maybe a little seltzer?

1455
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,557
出去！
Out!

1456
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,528
James，多麼有趣的聚會啊。
James, such a fun party.

1457
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,606
你的Penelope什麼時候出來？
When's your Penelope going to appear?

1458
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,900
也許她拉鍊卡住了。我去看看。
Maybe she's having zipper trouble. I'll just go and see.

1459
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,032
Mannix 醫生。
Dr. Mannix.

1460
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,787
我不知道精神病醫生會上門看病。
I didn't know a psychiatrist made house calls.

1461
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,493
我是個客人。
I am a guest.

1462
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,749
我還有請柬，看到了嗎？
And I have an invitation. See?

1463
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,751
你有過。現在沒有了。
You did. Now you don't.

1464
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:35,837
那不是挺孩子氣的做法嗎？
Isn't that a rather childish thing to do?

1465
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,543
那來點更成熟的怎麼樣？
Then how about something more grownup?

1466
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:39,299
比如，給你一拳鼻子怎麼樣？
Say, a punch in the nose?

1467
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:42,256
把你身上的怒氣發泄到我身上對你沒用。
Taking out your aggressions on me is not going to help you.

1468
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:44,511
對你沒用，但你也幫不了我妻子。
It won't help you, but then you're not helping my wife.

1469
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,893
我只負責這案子三年，先生。
I've only been on the case for three years, sir.

1470
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,392
到這段時間結束時，你的病人，你以前的病人
At the end of which time, your patient, your former patient

1471
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,127
比起開始時更糟了。
is worse off than when she first started with you.

1472
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,688
以前的？你說以前的是什麼意思？我不明白。
Former? W-W-What do you mean by, uh, former? I don't understand.

1473
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,269
那我來解釋。你被解僱了。
Then I'll explain. You're fired.

1474
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,730
等等！Elcott，你不能那樣！
Wait! Elcott, you can't do that!

1475
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,535
Penny。Penny？
Penny. Penny?

1476
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,287
嗯，有事嗎？
Yes, what is it?

1477
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,039
大家都在找你，親愛的。你要出來嗎？
Everyone's asking for you, honey. Are you coming out?

1478
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,166
我告訴過你，要的。
I told you, yes.

1479
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:15,464
什麼時候？
When?

1480
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,334
等Mildred Halliday來了我就出來。
As soon as Mildred Halliday gets here.

1481
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,715
Mildred Halliday和這有什麼關係？
What's Mildred Halliday got to do with it?

1482
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,140
你會看到的。
You'll see.

1483
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:29,929
Penny，讓我進去我們談談，好嗎？
Penny, just let me in and we'll talk it over, huh?

1484
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,227
Penny，如果你能回答我就好了。
Penny, if you'll just answer me.

1485
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,933
Penny，開門！
Penny, open!

1486
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,319
這個門把有點卡。哦。
This knob, it sticks. Oh.

1487
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,842
- 我得找個螺絲刀。- 嗯哼。
- I have to get a screwdriver. - Mm-hmm.

1488
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:42,448
你應該在黃頁裏找找。
Well, you should try to find it in the yellow pages.

1489
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:44,447
或者打開我的門。
Or open my door.

1490
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,951
你好，Mildred。歡迎來參加聚會。
Hello, Mildred. Welcome to the party.

1491
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:57,756
哦，James，確保Mildred得到她想要的一切。
Oh, James, make sure Mildred gets everything she wants.

1492
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:03,386
- 哦，可憐的親愛的。- 哦，Mildred。
- Oh, poor darling. - Oh, Mildred.

1493
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:04,883
你能幫我一個忙嗎？
Would you mind doing me a favor?

1494
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,761
哦，任何事，任何事。
Oh, anything, anything.

1495
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,888
試着換個人親一下，行嗎？
Try kissing somebody else for a change, huh?

1496
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,014
說真的，我確實有親，
Well, honestly, I do,

1497
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,892
但我就是不那麼享受了。
but I just don't enjoy it as much.

1498
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:24,446
一杯雙份蘇格蘭威士忌。蘇打還是加冰？
A double scotch. Soda or over the rocks?

1499
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,868
再來一杯雙份蘇格蘭威士忌。
Over another double scotch.

1500
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,866
哦，真美味，我敬這一杯。
Ooh, yummy, I'll drink to that.

1501
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:48,848
晚上好。晚上好。
Good evening. Good evening.

1502
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,309
晚上好，James。
Good evening, James.

1503
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:54,012
Penny，這都是怎麼回事？你會看的。
Penny, what's all this? You'll see.

1504
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:01,565
親愛的Heller小姐，很高興你能來。
Dear miss Heller, so good of you to come.

1505
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,740
你最近有看到什麼好游泳池的底部嗎？
Have you seen the bottom of any good swimming pools lately?

1506
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:11,822
搞錯了？我……
Mistaken? I...

1507
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,296
Daphne。Daphne，親愛的。
Daphne. Daphne, darling.

1508
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:22,625
下次你去跳迪斯科的時候，要小心點。
The next time you go discothequeing, you should be more careful.

1509
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,380
你把你的王冠弄丟了。
You lost your tiara.

1510
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:26,837
James，這是她的惡作劇嗎？
James, is this her idea of a joke?

1511
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,674
Penny，親愛的，進來吧。
Penny darling, come inside.

1512
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,016
Mildred，不知爲什麼
Mildred, for some reason

1513
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,143
他們似乎不想把首飾要回去。
they don't seem to want their jewelry back.

1514
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,815
但我確定你會的。
But I'm sure you will.

1515
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:41,063
我婚禮那天的紀念物。
A memento of my wedding day.

1516
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,988
親愛的 Penelope，你總是
Dear Penelope, you always did

1517
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:47,282
有那麼古怪的幽默感。
have such a quaint sense of humor.

1518
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:49,576
我這輩子從沒見過那些綠寶石。
I never saw those emeralds in my life.

1519
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:56,208
- Mildred！ - Penny，求你了。
- Mildred! - Penny, please.

1520
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,411
James，有些不對勁。
James, something's wrong.

1521
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:01,462
非常嚴重的不對勁。
Something's terribly wrong.

1522
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,211
我很害怕。
I'm frightened.

1523
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:04,666
Penelope，等等！
Penelope, wait!

1524
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:10,342
- Penelope！ Penelope，等等！ - Jimmy，讓她走。
- Penelope! Penelope, wait! - Jimmy, let her go.

1525
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,328
她知道自己出醜了，感到很尷尬。
She knows she's made a fool of herself and she's embarrassed.

1526
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:14,638
- 我得阻止她。
- 哦，如果你阻止她你會後悔的。
- I've got to stop her. - Oh, you'll be sorry if you do.

1527
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,140
如果我不阻止她，我會後悔。
I'll be sorry if I don't.

1528
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,236
整晚。
All night long.

1529
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:09,065
我跟你說我擔心得要命。
I tell you I'm frantic with worry.

1530
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,365
如果你想起什麼...
If you think of anything...

1531
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,443
很明顯她覺得你辜負了她。
Well, it's obvious she thinks you've failed her.

1532
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:13,743
她很困惑。
She's confused.

1533
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,070
而在她的困惑中
And in her confusion

1534
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,622
她會轉向她唯一信任的人。
she'll turn to the one person she can trust.

1535
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,825
就是我。冷靜點，Elcott。
Yours truly. Just calm down, Elcott.

1536
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,626
我們正在盡一切努力。
We're doing everything we can.

1537
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,078
如果你妻子覺得有危險，
If your wife feels in any danger,

1538
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:26,085
無冒犯之意，她會來找我尋求保護。
no offense, it's me that she'll come to for protection.

1539
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:46,476
Serena 小姐。
Miss Serena.

1540
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,812
- 哦，多甜的名字。 - 謝謝。
- Oh, what a sweet name. - Thank you.

1541
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:51,023
我總認爲名字有很大影響...
I always think that names have a great influence...

1542
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,631
你以爲是誰... 哎呦！
Who do you think... ow!

1543
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,799
好，讓我來... 小心。
Alright, let me... watch out.

1544
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:13,045
我不怕你，你這個大惡霸。
I'm not afraid of you, you big bully.

1545
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:16,131
一個老太太拿走...（這個主意）
The idea of an old woman taking a...

1546
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,349
可恥！
Shame on you!

1547
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,570
防碎的，哈！
Shatterproof, ha!

1548
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,077
把那該死的東西關掉！
Shut that damn thing off!

1549
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,532
謝謝。
Thank you.

1550
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:53,298
啊，我的可育雞蛋和酸奶。我要告你。
Oh, my fertile eggs and my yogurt. I'll sue you.

1551
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:57,347
現在看看是誰戴着這張可笑的面具。
Now let's see who's under this ridiculous-looking mask.

1552
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,136
她給我十塊錢的時候可沒提過要捏鼻子這事。
She didn't say nothin' about nose-tweaking

1553
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,686
她給我十塊錢的時候可沒提過。
when she give me the ten bucks.

1554
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:05,604
她？誰？
She? Who?

1555
01:30:05,692 --> 01:30:08,980
她說是個惡作劇，我信了她。
A practical joke, she said, and I believed her.

1556
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,187
她那雙又大又悲傷的褐色眼睛，
Her with those big, sad brown eyes,

1557
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,819
她還能那麼會哭。
and how she could cry.

1558
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,985
她長什麼樣？
What did she look like?

1559
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,915
年輕、漂亮，穿着白色晚禮服，
Young, pretty, white evening gown

1560
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,960
大概就是這樣子。
and about so big.

1561
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,713
Penelope。
Penelope.

1562
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:38,422
- 哦！ - 親愛的，是我。
- Oh! - Darling, it's me.

1563
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,057
不是你。
It isn't you.

1564
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:44,227
我們被搶了。就在後面，當我們都在這兒的時候。
We've been robbed. Back there while we were all up here.

1565
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,771
Penelope。
Penelope.

1566
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,906
Elcott，等一下。
Elcott, wait a minute.

1567
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,654
我知道。跟着那輛出租車。
I know. Follow the cab.

1568
01:30:58,745 --> 01:31:00,485
不，不，我在找一個女孩。
No, no, I'm looking for a girl.

1569
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:01,820
誰不是？
Who ain't?

1570
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,076
她應該剛從銀行出來。
And she'd have just come out of the bank.

1571
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,249
- 甩得很迷人？ - 是的，是的。
- With a real nice wiggle? - Yes, yes.

1572
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:07,826
她，她，她往哪邊走了？
Which, which-which way did she go?

1573
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,411
往市區方向。
Downtown.

1574
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,834
往市區？
Downtown?

1575
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,754
你盯着什麼看，Mac？
What you starin' at, Mac?

1576
01:31:21,101 --> 01:31:22,386
那張臉。
That face.

1577
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,098
哦，剛纔那一刻，你看起來就像我太太。
Oh, for-for a moment, you looked just like my wife.

1578
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,601
我還以爲我娶的是條狗。
And I thought mine was a dog.

1579
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,028
你說往市區？
Downtown, you said?

1580
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,982
呃，帶我去中心街，警察局總部。
Uh, take me to centre street, police headquarters.

1581
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:43,198
Penelope？
Penelope?

1582
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,490
我說得對。你來找我了。
I was right. You came to me.

1583
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:47,824
我還能去找誰？
Who else would I come to?

1584
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,063
你要我先走嗎，不等你？
You want me to go ahead without you?

1585
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,668
聽着，你不會相信的，
Listen, you're not gonna believe this,

1586
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:53,041
可有人剛搶了你丈夫的銀行。
but somebody just knocked over your husband's bank.

1587
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,920
嗯，你可能不信，但我信你。
Well, you won't believe this, but I believe you.

1588
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,718
你搶了你丈夫的銀行？
You robbed your husband's bank?

1589
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:00,921
不止一次。兩次。
Twice.

1590
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:09,813
中士，我剛破了 Elcott 案。
Sergeant, I just solved the Elcott case.

1591
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:13,775
長大後我想當個像你這樣的警察。
When I grow up, I wanna be a cop just like you.

1592
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,465
你現在得放了 Honeysuckle，是吧？
You'll have to release honeysuckle now, won't you?

1593
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,150
以童子軍的名譽發誓。
Scout's honor.

1594
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:21,824
我來了，我來了。
I'm going, I'm going.

1595
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:29,117
嗯，我想我們可能不會再見面了。
Well, I, uh, I guess we won't be seeing one another anymore.

1596
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,620
你們不會要逮捕我嗎？
Aren't you gonna arrest me?

1597
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,828
除非銀行行長提出起訴，
Not unless the bank president presses charges,

1598
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:34,537
否則幾乎不太可能。
which is hardly likely.

1599
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:37,712
謝謝你，Horatio。
Thank you, Horatio.

1600
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,301
不客氣，Penelope。
You're welcome, Penelope.

1601
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,845
好吧，這段犯罪生涯雖短，但很精彩。
Well, it was a great criminal career while it lasted.

1602
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:56,563
算是最棒的之一。
One of the best.

1603
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,633
Elcott 先生，進來吧。
Mr. Elcott, come on in.

1604
01:33:26,726 --> 01:33:28,933
我從沒見你在五點之前喝東西。
I've never seen you take a drink before 5:00.

1605
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,219
總有地方是五點鐘。
It's gotta be 5:00 someplace.

1606
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,348
可你不是 Penelope。
But you're not Penelope.

1607
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,604
聽到了嗎？
Hear that?

1608
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,311
這個人居然把他妻子送去看瘋醫生。
And this guy sends his wife to the crazy doctor.

1609
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,162
我不認爲威士忌是你的解藥。
I don't think whisky's your answer.

1610
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,203
Gregory。
Gregory.

1611
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,294
Gregory？
Gregory?

1612
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,960
我告訴他你會來找我。
I told him you would turn to me.

1613
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,164
哦，我還能去找誰呢？
Oh, who else could I turn to?

1614
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,920
感謝上天你平安無事。
Thank heaven you're safe and sound.

1615
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,750
安全但不正常。
Safe but not sound.

1616
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:05,303
Gregory，我真的很害怕。
Gregory, I'm really frightened.

1617
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,722
我一定有很嚴重的問題。
There must be something terribly wrong with me.

1618
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,925
我的意思是，我就是無法理解
I mean, I just cannot get it through my head

1619
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,556
我並沒有真的偷那些珠寶這件事。
that I didn't actually steal all those jewels.

1620
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,353
然而我知道我不可能偷。
And yet I know I couldn't have.

1621
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,101
你確實偷了那些珠寶。
You did steal the jewels.

1622
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:20,005
他們讓保險公司
They stuck the insurance companies

1623
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:21,394
承擔了這些索賠，吃了大虧，
with their claims but good,

1624
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,855
所以自然他們不想要這些東西回去。
so naturally, they didn't want the stuff back.

1625
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,621
那我就完全痊癒了。
Then I'm completely cured.

1626
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,078
真的嗎？
You are?

1627
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:37,035
是的。我不是告訴過你嗎？
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

1628
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,247
我剛又把 James 的銀行搶了一次。
I just finished robbing James' bank again.

1629
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,502
可你已經完全康復了？
But you're completely cured?

1630
01:34:42,594 --> 01:34:43,959
當然了。
Of course.

1631
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:45,759
因爲當我做那事的時候
Because the whole time I was doing it

1632
01:34:45,847 --> 01:34:47,428
我哭得很厲害。
I was crying like anything.

1633
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:48,721
你不明白嗎？
Don't you get it?

1634
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:51,390
看，偷東西不再讓我開心了。
You see, the stealing didn't make me cheerful anymore.

1635
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:52,717
它讓我感覺很糟糕。
It made me feel rotten.

1636
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:55,178
所以這意味着我不是竊盜癖。
So that means I'm not a kleptomaniac.

1637
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:56,729
這不是很好嗎？
Isn't that wonderful?

1638
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:59,315
那真糟糕。
That's terrible.

1639
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:02,314
不再偷東西。不再有愛好。
No more stealing. No more hobbies.

1640
01:35:02,405 --> 01:35:04,191
也不再有婚姻。
No more marriage.

1641
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:06,147
只有感到糟糕。
Just feeling rotten.

1642
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:07,948
這好嗎？
Is that wonderful?

1643
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,656
接下來怎麼辦？
What next?

1644
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:12,703
嗯，你可以嫁給我。
Well, you could marry me.

1645
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,530
我知道這聽起來不道德，
I know it sounds unethical,

1646
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:15,991
而且你可能會難以
and you'd probably have difficulty

1647
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,076
把我從父親般的角色調整爲情人形象。
readjusting me from a father figure

1648
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:19,627
把我從父親形象調整爲情人形象。
to a lover image.

1649
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:22,539
而且我可能對你來說太高了。
And I'm probably too tall for you.

1650
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,170
太老了。
Too old.

1651
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:26,000
我敢肯定你沒有足夠的壁櫥空間
I'm sure you don't have enough closet space

1652
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:27,960
給我的衣服放在你公寓裏。
for my clothes in your apartment.

1653
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,254
我會打呼嚕，而且...
I do snore a lot and...

1654
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:34,058
我有胃潰瘍。
I have this ulcer.

1655
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,597
Dr. Knoblock！
Dr. Knoblock!

1656
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,855
我需要幫助！
I need help!

1657
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:46,052
Penelope，你怎麼能這樣對我？
How could you do this to me, Penelope?

1658
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:49,107
你知道我受不了被拒絕。
You know I can't stand rejection.

1659
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,620
Penelope。
Penelope.

1660
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:01,874
Mannix 醫生。
Dr. Mannix.

1661
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:05,878
呃，你，你得幫我。
Uh, you, you've got to help me.

1662
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:09,382
我看哪裏，眼裏全是 Penelope。
Everywhere I look, all I can see is Penelope.

1663
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:12,179
在銀行、出租車上、在警察局。
In the bank, in the cab, at the police station.

1664
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:13,387
就在剛纔我進來時，
And just now when I came in,

1665
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:15,637
連你在我眼裏也像 Penelope。
even you looked like Penelope to me.

1666
01:36:15,728 --> 01:36:18,060
我知道這一切都和愛她、想念她混在一起
I know it's all mixed up with loving her and missing her

1667
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:20,058
還有，那種內疚感
and, and feeling guilty

1668
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:23,186
因爲那家愚蠢的銀行而把她擠到一邊。
about shoving her aside for that stupid bank.

1669
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:26,898
我可能不該把這些無聊事說給你聽。
I probably shouldn't be boring you with all this.

1670
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:28,355
哦，不，別停下來。
Oh, no, don't stop now.

1671
01:36:28,449 --> 01:36:30,405
你正說到精彩部分。
You're just getting to the good part.

1672
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,905
啊，現在我真的迷失了。
Ah, now I'm really gone.

1673
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:34,987
你甚至聽起來像她。
You even sound like her.

1674
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:38,244
要是有什麼辦法，要是我能找到她
If there was only some way, if I could only find her

1675
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:40,825
告訴她我有多需要她。
and tell her how much I need her.

1676
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,343
Mannix 醫生，你需要幫助。
Dr. Mannix, you need help.

1677
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:52,825
現在大家都需要。
Everybody does these days.

1678
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,326
唯一不同的是，我們這些適應得較好的人
The only difference is, we well-adjusted

1679
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:56,591
還能及時意識到。
maladjusted ones realize it in time.

1680
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,474
而且，最好的幫助
And besides, the best help of all

1681
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,476
就是在家裏才能得到的那種幫助。
is the kind you can only get at home.

1682
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:16,698
忘記鞋子意味着什麼？
What does it mean when you forget your shoes?

1683
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:19,326
- 嗯... - 這意味着我們都治好了，親愛的。
- Well... - It means we're cured, darling.
