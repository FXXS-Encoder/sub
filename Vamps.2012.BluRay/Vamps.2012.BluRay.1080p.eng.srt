1
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,062
Hello, my name is Goody,

2
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:40,566
and in 1841, I was bitten by a stem vampire.

3
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:43,068
A stem is able to awaken the victims

4
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:44,737
they choose not to drain.

5
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,438
Normally, this would be one of those tales

6
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,741
of gore and homicidal urges,

7
00:00:48,774 --> 00:00:50,676
but I've always looked on the bright side.

8
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,511
So I learned to live on animal blood.

9
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,113
And having eternal life

10
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,982
gave me extra years with my loved ones.

11
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,118
Nighttime used to be dull and dark,

12
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,453
but things got a lot better in the '80s.

13
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:04,056
Oh, the 1880s, that is.

14
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,425
The Industrial Revolution gave us electricity

15
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,160
and light bulbs.

16
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,562
And suddenly, nights were as bright as daytime.

17
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:11,830
Telephones replaced letters,

18
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,500
and the new subways let you travel the whole city

19
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,069
and still be in your coffin by sunrise.

20
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:20,239
In the 1920s, things really turned modern.

21
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,074
Skirts got shorter,

22
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:25,277
jazz babies and flappers owned the night.

23
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,012
The world belonged to the young,

24
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,181
and I was an expert at being young.

25
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,050
And then came my favorite invention--

26
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,184
flickers.

27
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,054
Chaplin, Keaton, Cagney--

28
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,456
and in movies, they never got any older.

29
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,058
I could relate.

30
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,794
In the 1960s, I messed up.

31
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,195
I let my guard down

32
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:48,334
After that, things started to go downhill.

33
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:51,470
In the '70s, I kinda lost interest in dating.

34
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:54,239
But in the '90s, my stem turned Stacy.

35
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:57,643
She was kind of lost and I took care of her.

36
00:01:57,676 --> 00:02:00,179
I taught her to get hometown soil for her coffin,

37
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:02,381
how to use hypnotic powers,

38
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,683
and how to find the jugular on a rodent.

39
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,586
And she taught me about e-mail,

40
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,189
Napster, and this great group,

41
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:11,623
Green Day.

42
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,825
So we have lots of fun.

43
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:15,461
We party with normal kids, we go to college.

44
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,730
I've got over 10,000 credits.

45
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,132
I could graduate if it wasn't during the day.

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,502
I love having a friend,

47
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,804
or "bestie," as she calls it.

48
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:27,773
And, aw, look how cute she is.

49
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,543
Hey, Goody.

50
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,079
Goody, wake up. It's sunset.

51
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,323
The only bad thing about Stacy

52
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,849
are her practical jokes,

53
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:40,185
which she thinks are way funnier than they actually are.

54
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,653
What?

55
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:43,222
No, you didn't.

56
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:45,190
Come on, let me out.

57
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,497
- You got me
- Again.

58
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:59,071
Hurry, I've got an 8:00 class.

59
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,741
Hey, Stacy. Your friend from Boston

60
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:04,176
sent your hometown soil.

61
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,744
Oh, thank God.

62
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:08,480
I hardly have any left. My back has been killing me.

63
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,186
"We're sorry but your package has

64
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,188
accidentally been harmed in delivery."

65
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,857
I think the Post Office x-rays everything now,

66
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,859
and this looked suspicious so they opened it.

67
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:22,394
But this is just dirt.

68
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,730
Yeah, but you know Homeland Security.

69
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:27,566
Man, the terrorists ruined things for everybody.

70
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:32,671
"Visit us at www--"

71
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:33,782
why do they call it visiting?

72
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:37,276
Isn't it more like "type us a letter on the computer"?

73
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:40,312
Visiting is when you go somewhere.

74
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,823
Yeah, you're at one place on the Internet,

75
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,315
and then you go someplace else.

76
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,350
That doesn't make any sense. Yes, it does.

77
00:03:45,384 --> 00:03:47,419
So if you're reading a book and you turn the page,

78
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:49,188
are you visiting another page?

79
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,758
Hold on. You still can't find your mouth

80
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,259
without a mirror? Thank you.

81
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,533
Sunrise is at 6:40.

82
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,335
You know, I put that app in your phone.

83
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,503
You don't need the almanac.

84
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,605
I like my almanac.

85
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:09,341
What's with the mom jeans?

86
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,343
Jeans are jeans. Are you kidding?

87
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,179
Jeans mark your age more than a birth certificate.

88
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,815
Trade shoes. At least my gladiators

89
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:18,350
will get you in the right millennium.

90
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,652
Those are cute. Race you.

91
00:04:20,686 --> 00:04:22,554
Oh!

92
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,662
Took you long enough. Well, that didn't count.

93
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:33,198
These aren't my shoes. Excuses, excuses.

94
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,133
Oh, for goodness' sake.

95
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,235
What time does your class end? 9:30.

96
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:37,736
Okay, then I'll meet you at work.

97
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,173
Oh, God. Where are you going?

98
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:44,209
Come back here.

99
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,246
Goody!

100
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,282
Cradle of Filth, Ozzy Osbourne, The Cure--

101
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,850
Ooh, where?

102
00:04:51,884 --> 00:04:55,220
Oh, no. It's one of those daytime festival things.

103
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,564
Whose idiot idea was it

104
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,423
to have rock concerts during the day?

105
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,233
Mmm. Let's check the traps.

106
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,435
Ugh, rats will eat anything.

107
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:17,409
Oh, dead one.

108
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,578
Oh, trap got him?

109
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,347
I think the artificial sweeteners gave him cancer.

110
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:25,250
53rd Street.

111
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,151
53rd Street.

112
00:05:26,184 --> 00:05:28,453
And 6th Avenue.

113
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,357
53rd Street and 6th Avenue.

114
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:33,992
Penthouse suite.

115
00:05:34,026 --> 00:05:35,570
We're being summoned.

116
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:37,963
Ask me questions. Who's the stupidest person on TV?

117
00:05:37,996 --> 00:05:40,599
Uh, Snooki! Oh, yes. You're right.

118
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,434
53rd Street.

119
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,603
Who's the smartest?

120
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:48,273
Um, House or Frylock? Who?

121
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,343
The limping doctor or the flying French fry.

122
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:52,744
53rd Street.

123
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:55,581
Okay, 53rd Street.

124
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,518
Don't you love Times Square?

125
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,386
It feels like the center of the world.

126
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,522
I feel like a bunch of TVs threw up.

127
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,624
Take a cab. What are you, walking?

128
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,326
Okay, okay. We're coming.

129
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,329
What kind of mood is she in?

130
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:11,906
I've seen worse. Has she finished feeding?

131
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,770
Because we don't want to be around any of that.

132
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,802
Where are my offshoots?

133
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,270
There they are.

134
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,806
Look at the new fall line.

135
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,809
Gaultier, Prada.

136
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,445
Dress.

137
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:28,447
And I can never see how I look in them.

138
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:31,850
What is the point of looking like this

139
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:34,353
if I can never enjoy it?

140
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:35,687
Hmm?

141
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,990
Oh, sucks hard. Not so nice.

142
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,926
So put them on and then I will just imagine

143
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,296
how much better they will look on me.

144
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,333
Ivan, call Mr. Pizza Guy.

145
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,968
I thought we were going out.

146
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,403
I feel like a pizza guy.

147
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:54,506
Oh, come on. Those clothes are wearing you.

148
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,408
Give it some juice.

149
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,910
I don't know about this one. Why not?

150
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:01,346
It's just not for young people.

151
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:03,615
Excuse me?

152
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,952
Are you telling me about being young?

153
00:07:06,985 --> 00:07:08,820
Do you have any idea

154
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,556
how long I have been young?

155
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,468
She just means that, with the recession and all,

156
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:15,436
girls of a certain age couldn't afford something like this.

157
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,363
Plus, it's fur. It's like wearing a dead animal.

158
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,365
Okay, here's the flaw in that argument.

159
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,034
Why should the life of a mink

160
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,603
be more valuable than the life of a pigeon?

161
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,538
You two drink pigeons every day.

162
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,440
We set them free.

163
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:31,443
Stacy got attached. To pigeons?

164
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:32,720
You know what? We never should've named them.

165
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,379
I know, you're so right.

166
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,990
I mean, how can you hurt something named Snuggles?

167
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:37,549
Or Mr. Doodles? Do you remember--

168
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,584
You're pathetic.

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,754
Pizza guy.

170
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:46,091
Pizza guy.

171
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,396
Who ordered the double cheese and sausage?

172
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,998
You're late.

173
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,067
They said 20 minutes or less.

174
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,170
You kept me waiting, you bad boy.

175
00:07:58,203 --> 00:07:59,604
Sorry.

176
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:02,474
You know what happens to bad boys.

177
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,814
I hate when she's in town.

178
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,916
It's disgusting. I know.

179
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,551
But let's just have a good time.

180
00:08:12,584 --> 00:08:14,586
- Come on, we deserve it.
- Taxi!

181
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,921
Besides, it's goth night.

182
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,423
And all the day players always dress up so cute.

183
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:33,538
We're the oldest ones here.

184
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:35,073
Except for this schmohawk.

185
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:37,609
Can I buy you ladies a drink? We never drink...

186
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,544
mojitos.

187
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:41,446
Maybe you should court someone your own age.

188
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,648
Oh, did you see that cute one? Mm-hmm.

189
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:46,151
Hey. Hey, Renfield.

190
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:48,620
Adam Ant called. He wants his makeup back.

191
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,590
Oh, come on. Awaken me. I wanna live forever.

192
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,592
Then you should try eating more broccoli.

193
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,803
No, I don't want to eat more broccoli. I want to be undead.

194
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,029
You are undead. You're alive.

195
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,599
Yeah, stop imagining crazy ideas.

196
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,503
No.

197
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:07,239
What? Stuck-up McVainypants is here.

198
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:10,709
So what? Just ignore him.

199
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:12,511
Show him how much fun you're having.

200
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,147
What? No! No pictures.

201
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,882
Wh-- then take me.

202
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:18,617
Come on. Let's just go dance.

203
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:25,624
Isn't this place a little Mickey Mouse for you?

204
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,230
There is Donor Club in Chinatown.

205
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:33,899
I don't know what you're talking about.

206
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:37,669
I think I can sense a real vampire.

207
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,505
Vampire? That word is so cornball.

208
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,008
And anyone who says "cornball"

209
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,876
is at least 80 years old.

210
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,613
Okay. I just don't appreciate

211
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,148
being called the V-word.

212
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:51,516
You prefer ELF?

213
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,219
Extended Life Form, yes.

214
00:09:54,252 --> 00:09:56,621
So gay.

215
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,557
Hey. Hi, Ivan.

216
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,926
I see you met Vadim. You know he's my stem.

217
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,961
Oh, you're the Soviet stem.

218
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,564
Ukrainian.

219
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,301
Let's go to that club. Blood Bank.

220
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,703
We don't feed off of people.

221
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,705
Oh, great.

222
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,507
As long as Cisserus takes care of herself.

223
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:19,277
Why? Anything happens to her,

224
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:21,913
your years will accrue.

225
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:23,715
You wouldn't want

226
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,851
to look your age.

227
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:27,652
Excuse me.

228
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,597
I am Vadim. This is Ivan.

229
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,932
I'll get my coat.

230
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:45,070
Oh, Juicy. She is asking for it.

231
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,638
Yeah, I'd say so.

232
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:51,576
Listen to me.

233
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,679
Vadim and Ivan are bad guys.

234
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,914
I like bad guys.

235
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:02,187
No, you like nice guys.

236
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,223
Don't look at them and don't talk to them.

237
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:06,758
Don't talk to them.

238
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,361
And remember, nice guys.

239
00:11:09,394 --> 00:11:11,229
Nice guys.

240
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:20,105
Guys that listen when you say stuff.

241
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,774
Guys that compliment you.

242
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,609
Hey, Juicy. Where are you going?

243
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:06,117
- Hey. We're gonna go.
- BRB.

244
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:09,788
Um, that only works if you're leaving.

245
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,122
"Be right back."

246
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:14,659
Oh. SL. What?

247
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,762
"So long"? Close enough.

248
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,879
So I tell my parents I'm coming to the city for my music.

249
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:27,038
And they say okay, as long as I go to NYU.

250
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,707
You want?

251
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,176
No thanks. I'm already in the mood.

252
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,690
So now they're all, "What about law school?"

253
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,792
And I go, "I told you I was coming here for my music."

254
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:40,051
So they're, "Then why did we spend $100,000, Derek?"

255
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:41,829
I'm like, "You got me. You could've just gotten me

256
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,397
Pro Tools and I'd be happy. Law school is your dream,

257
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:44,389
not mine."

258
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,391
And they think it's all about record deals,

259
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:47,935
but it's so different now. They're so old-fashioned.

260
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,327
They just don't get it, you know?

261
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,696
Hey, my parents believed in witches.

262
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,732
Hold on, I gotta play you something.

263
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,236
Mm.

264
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:09,180
You've got-- you've got something.

265
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:12,217
Hmm? You want a rail?

266
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,394
A little bit won't hurt.

267
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,083
I gotta get out of here.

268
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:54,159
Hey, people can see you.

269
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,827
What? Nobody cares.

270
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,163
Besides, the streets are wet and my shoes are suede.

271
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,865
Stacy, I kinda did something bad.

272
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:03,301
What? Well, this drummer guy

273
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,770
was all coked up and his nose started bleeding.

274
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,273
- Oh, no.
- I just licked a drop.

275
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,151
And what now? Are you jonesing? Do you have the hunger?

276
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,443
No.

277
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,845
I just had what came out. It wasn't even flowing.

278
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:17,549
But I know it would be so much more satisfying than this whole

279
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:19,918
get-dressed-go-out- and-have-sex routine.

280
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,320
I mean, guys used to want to sing

281
00:14:22,353 --> 00:14:24,055
or paint or write.

282
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:26,958
Now, it's like iPod hits and webisodes.

283
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,103
Half the time, I don't even know what they're talking about.

284
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,205
Well, we're going to group tomorrow. That always helps.

285
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:33,498
Hey.

286
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:35,567
Didn't that used to be a yogurt place?

287
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,168
Things keep changing around here.

288
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,904
Well, in the '70s, it was a methadone clinic

289
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,240
and all the hippies would be sitting on the stairs

290
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,142
waiting for their medicine.

291
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,544
And in the '50s, it was a dance studio,

292
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:50,982
and everyone came to the Village to be beatniks.

293
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,485
And before that, it was a German newspaper.

294
00:14:54,586 --> 00:14:56,020
How do you know this stuff?

295
00:14:57,088 --> 00:15:00,258
The History Channel. Oh.

296
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,327
Uh-oh, birds.

297
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,962
Hurry. Go, go! Whoops!

298
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,396
Get back. Watch out, Kenny!

299
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,432
Oh!

300
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:17,876
That's Van Helsing. Let him through.

301
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:21,246
Oh, no, no, no. This doesn't have

302
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,847
anything to do with Homeland Security

303
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,549
so get away from my crime scene, huh?

304
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,084
Did you recover the neck?

305
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:28,953
Look, it's your garden variety John Doe.

306
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:30,889
Killed, bled out someplace else,

307
00:15:30,922 --> 00:15:32,557
they hacked it up and dumped it here.

308
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,326
You call this bled out? It's bone dry.

309
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,794
Detective.

310
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,898
Excuse me, ma'am. I need you to back up, please.

311
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:42,500
What is that, a pizza carrier?

312
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,471
There. You happy now?

313
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:49,207
Hey, if we find a subway map and explosives, we'll call you.

314
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,845
Whoa.

315
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,916
Good evening. My name is Harry,

316
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,851
and welcome to Sanguines Anonymous.

317
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,990
Tepish, you're a stem, aren't you?

318
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:08,526
Someone told me that if a stem dies,

319
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,428
all the offshoots die.

320
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,530
It's an old wives' tale, right?

321
00:16:12,564 --> 00:16:14,575
I thought as long as you stayed out of the sun, you're okay.

322
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,035
And if your stem died, you start aging.

323
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:21,039
No, you start aging, but not like the day players.

324
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:24,108
You become your chronological age.

325
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:25,910
When were you awakened?

326
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,445
1841.

327
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,914
Ah, pfft. Baby.

328
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,017
Besides, 200 is the new 80.

329
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:35,420
Stacy turned in 1992.

330
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,922
Does she know how old you are?

331
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,324
No.

332
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,460
It seemed to comfort her thinking we were the same age.

333
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:43,928
Ah, I see.

334
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,931
You're from Cisserus, huh? You know her?

335
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,968
We had a fling.

336
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,436
Mm.

337
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,105
That took about a century off my life.

338
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,640
Hey.

339
00:16:57,108 --> 00:17:00,511
Tepish, would you like to start off tonight?

340
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:02,213
Okay.

341
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:07,018
Thank you, Harry.

342
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:08,553
Hi, everyone.

343
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,555
I am Vlad Tepish.

344
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,023
You know, Vlad the Impaler.

345
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,391
Hi, Vlad Tepish.

346
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:17,362
I have abstained from the fluids of homo sapiens

347
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:21,299
for 362 years.

348
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,747
I'm sure that you've heard about what I did

349
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,273
to the Turkish army, huh?

350
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:29,507
He impaled them.

351
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,677
You youngsters have to learn how to substitute

352
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,981
what you can't do with things that are less harmful.

353
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,084
Personally, I like knitting.

354
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,653
Especially...

355
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,057
this part.

356
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,959
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

357
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,034
Hi, I'm Stacy. Hi, Stacy.

358
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,070
I've been in my 20s for two decades,

359
00:17:59,103 --> 00:18:02,507
and when I was a day player, I was doing a lot of E.

360
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,542
E? I don't know what that is.

361
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,744
That's ecstasy.

362
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:10,214
And then one night, I must've been pretty stoned,

363
00:18:10,248 --> 00:18:11,582
'cause I don't even remember,

364
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:14,552
but I know Cisserus was feeding on me,

365
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:16,721
and Goody was arguing that I would be a good

366
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:18,489
clothing model for her.

367
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:21,292
So if it wasn't for Goody, I would be dead.

368
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,361
Like, dead-dead.

369
00:18:25,163 --> 00:18:28,099
But she says that I saved her because she'd been so lonely,

370
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:31,035
and having a friend made her want to keep existing.

371
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,072
Even though I've never had human blood,

372
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:35,807
I still feel tempted.

373
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,276
But it's like drugs.

374
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:40,812
We don't need the high-highs.

375
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,414
It's more satisfying to not hurt anybody

376
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,049
and just have fun with your friends.

377
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,421
- Thanks.
- Good meeting, people.

378
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:52,623
Shall we?

379
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:55,693
When it comes to drinking human blood,

380
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,596
a single drop is too much,

381
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:01,566
and a whole family is never enough.

382
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,801
Support your fellow ELFs.

383
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:07,472
Undead is not unfeeling.

384
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,173
Great.

385
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:29,127
What are you doing?

386
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,762
Don't you hate it when you sprout fangs,

387
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,131
part's white and then the other part's dingy?

388
00:19:33,164 --> 00:19:34,832
I never thought about it.

389
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:37,335
It's Renfield.

390
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:39,737
Hey, Renfield! Where are you guys?

391
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,272
Let's go to SoHo House.

392
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,141
I'm sick of these clip joints.

393
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:46,177
How about this? You go, and if it's great, text us.

394
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,412
All right. G2G.

395
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:49,280
G2G.

396
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,815
"Got to go."

397
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:54,285
Why can't kids say entire words?

398
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,220
It takes just as long to say letters.

399
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:58,389
Remember, we said that we'd keep up with the times

400
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:00,158
even though it's not as good as the '80s.

401
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:01,793
You don't hear me complaining every time

402
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,728
a new song comes on that Devo is much better.

403
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:05,630
That's true.

404
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,331
You have a glob.

405
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,834
Here? Other side.

406
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,837
Here? A little higher.

407
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,473
Doesn't it drive you crazy

408
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,141
not knowing what you look like?

409
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,552
You look the same as you always did.

410
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:21,145
You have pictures from before. No.

411
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,623
You don't have any pictures from your early years?

412
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,515
No.

413
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:26,350
A guy in the park drew this.

414
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,286
Do I look anything like this?

415
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,221
Oh, yeah.

416
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:31,823
He really captured you. Oh.

417
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,691
Hold on.

418
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,933
Okay, she sort of has your structure.

419
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:44,168
You have rounder eyes,

420
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,803
shorter chin,

421
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:48,506
change the hair,

422
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,874
green eyes,

423
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:51,676
and...

424
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,811
fix the nose.

425
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,580
And print.

426
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,586
Oh, my God.

427
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:06,290
That's me. Yeah.

428
00:21:06,324 --> 00:21:08,192
It's been so long.

429
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:12,430
I take back everything bad I ever said about computers.

430
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:13,931
Thank you. You're welcome.

431
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:15,333
Ooh.

432
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:24,575
Good morning. Morning.

433
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,255
Ew.

434
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:39,390
Well, LASIK has come a long way.

435
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,396
Hi, I'm Joey. Hi, I'm Stacy.

436
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:21,499
Hey, would you like to have lunch with me sometime?

437
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:22,934
No. Okay.

438
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,737
Um, no, what I meant was I work during the day

439
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:30,608
but I could have coffee or drinks.

440
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,543
Okay, great.

441
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,483
All right, any questions?

442
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:41,018
Yes, Professor Quincy.

443
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:43,321
How many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?

444
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:45,690
How many? A bicycle.

445
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:49,527
Well, thank you for that wonderful insight, Mr. Van Helsing.

446
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:54,865
All right, I know that was no "Talladega Nights."

447
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:57,268
Now what was Dalí trying to do in this?

448
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:02,473
Stacy, don't take a nap.

449
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,008
You'll be up all day.

450
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:07,044
I'm so tired. I was IM'ing all day.

451
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:11,749
I barely slept.

452
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:13,417
I met someone at school.

453
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,786
What's his story? He's silly.

454
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,722
Goofy but cute.

455
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:20,391
What's his name? His name?

456
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:22,360
Um, his name is Joey...

457
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:23,594
Van Helsing.

458
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:24,996
What?

459
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,399
I'm sure it's a coincidence. It's a common name.

460
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:31,369
And you didn't hit it off with Timmy Hitler?

461
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,670
Very funny.

462
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,071
I don't like it.

463
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:37,475
I can take care of myself.

464
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:42,780
Guess what Joey wants to do this weekend?

465
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:45,583
Behead you? Ha-ha.

466
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,895
I need to see my wife's chart.

467
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:51,689
You know, I've asked about four times in the past hour.

468
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,592
So get me the goddamn chart.

469
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:58,362
And don't start with the shifts.

470
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,898
And you won't be sued for malpractice

471
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:02,500
if you do it now.

472
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,468
Hell no, we won't go.

473
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:06,537
Hell no, we won't go.

474
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,072
Hell no--

475
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:10,508
Enough already. I've had enough.

476
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:29,994
Hi, honey. Hi, honey.

477
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:31,028
Love you.

478
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:34,432
I told them not to bring you any-- look at this.

479
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:36,701
I don't want you to eat this. Look at this.

480
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,103
They use this for breast implants in the other wing.

481
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,871
Guess where I went? Cappuccino.

482
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:43,708
Oh-- Look at this.

483
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,444
How much? How much do we love cannoli?

484
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:51,615
All right, maybe later.

485
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:55,586
How you doing in there?

486
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,089
Ugh.

487
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:01,692
I'm tired. Oh, shit.

488
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:05,463
You got jury duty. What?

489
00:25:05,496 --> 00:25:08,799
8:00 a.m. No.

490
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:10,501
How could this happen?

491
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:12,670
We're paid in cash. We don't do taxes.

492
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:14,114
I don't even have a driver's license.

493
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,682
Our credit cards are through a third party.

494
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:17,908
Oh. I voted once.

495
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:20,478
You what? I voted for Dukakis.

496
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:23,614
Dukakis? It was before I turned.

497
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,459
And I was just thinking about the good of the country.

498
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,651
Country? It's just business.

499
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:29,887
From the Dutch West India Company

500
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,589
to the slave trade.

501
00:25:31,622 --> 00:25:32,862
How do you know all this stuff?

502
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:36,560
Um, The History Channel.

503
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:40,231
Yay!

504
00:25:40,264 --> 00:25:43,100
If you're here and he's there, why don't you talk?

505
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:44,702
Nobody talks.

506
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:46,015
Do you want him to think I'm 40?

507
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:52,176
So, if the city has too much garbage,

508
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:53,644
and rats eat garbage,

509
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,613
why don't we just get rats to eat the garbage

510
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:57,515
instead of spraying toxic crap everywhere?

511
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:59,216
Rats breed too quickly. So?

512
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,651
What if we give them birth control?

513
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,219
You mean get rats to put on condoms?

514
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:04,622
Yeah. Teensy-weensy little condoms.

515
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:07,191
Who's that old hippie talking to Fred?

516
00:26:07,224 --> 00:26:09,136
You must mean the girls from the graveyard shift.

517
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,128
Shit. I used to go out with him

518
00:26:11,162 --> 00:26:12,630
before you and I knew each other.

519
00:26:12,663 --> 00:26:14,632
Oh, my God. He's gonna expect you to be like 40.

520
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:17,168
I know. Hi.

521
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,637
Wow.

522
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,071
How is it possible?

523
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:22,840
How is what possible?

524
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:27,511
Goody, you have not aged a day.

525
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,146
Mister, my name is Susan.

526
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,016
But my mother's name was Goody. Did you know her?

527
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,553
Goody Rutherford? Is that your mother?

528
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,621
Yes, but she passed away.

529
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:40,758
Oh. I-I-I'm sorry.

530
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:43,727
My name is Danny Horowitz.

531
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:46,497
Did she ever, uh, you know, like, mention me?

532
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,134
I think.

533
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,669
But we have to get to work. Hey.

534
00:26:51,702 --> 00:26:55,172
Hi, I under-- listen. I have to talk to you.

535
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:57,608
Please call me tomorrow.

536
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,009
Okay. Tomorrow night.

537
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,679
Night, of course.

538
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,581
Just like your mother.

539
00:27:03,614 --> 00:27:05,749
Okay.

540
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:15,025
So, is this your place? It's my parents' place.

541
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,561
When my ex and I broke up, I was traveling

542
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,698
and I haven't found a new place yet.

543
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,067
Iris recognition. So, what does your dad do?

544
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,935
Well, he works for Homeland Security now,

545
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:28,072
but he was with MI-6 in London for quite a long time.

546
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,841
So is he, um, some kind of spy?

547
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,078
Yeah, like James Bond but shorter.

548
00:27:35,713 --> 00:27:37,257
Listen, Stacy. There's something I have to tell you.

549
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,684
What? I'm older than you think.

550
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:43,354
I've been helping my dad with this project for a few years,

551
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:46,857
and since I'm still in school, you probably think I'm, like, 20.

552
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,926
But I'm almost 25.

553
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:52,763
And since you're like 17--

554
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,733
Um, actually I'm a little bit older

555
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,334
than the other kids, too.

556
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:59,103
You are?

557
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:01,772
Well, great. Well, how old are you?

558
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,108
You don't ask a lady her age.

559
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,644
Well, why not? Because it's very impolite.

560
00:28:06,677 --> 00:28:08,612
How am I gonna find out? I don't know.

561
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,681
I'm gonna nick your passport.

562
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:13,083
I'm never going again. The performance was ghastly.

563
00:28:13,117 --> 00:28:15,986
No, the clown was so--

564
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,188
Joey. Oh.

565
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:19,690
I didn't know you had company.

566
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,725
We just got back. This is Stacy.

567
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,394
Stacy, my mother and father.

568
00:28:23,427 --> 00:28:24,828
Hi, Stacy. Oh, pleasure.

569
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:26,196
Nice to meet you. Uh, yeah.

570
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,165
How do you do? Hi.

571
00:28:28,198 --> 00:28:29,709
Well, I actually have to get to my job.

572
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,068
You work at night?

573
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:33,103
Yeah, it's so depressing.

574
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:36,407
But, you know, just until school gets out.

575
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,175
I have to go. I'll see you out.

576
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:41,879
Ta! Yeah.

577
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,150
Did you feel her hands? Freezing.

578
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,931
I'm glad you're interested. Are you a registered voter?

579
00:28:50,955 --> 00:28:52,656
No matter what's going on in the world,

580
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,225
there's always someone protesting or petitioning,

581
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:57,695
and they always wind up in Union Square.

582
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:02,933
Even in the 1840s, people were pamphleteering for abolition.

583
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,969
...southern flesh peddlers!

584
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:07,271
Slavery will tear our country apart!

585
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:09,340
Sir, may I proffer you a pamphlet?

586
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,675
Abolition now!

587
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:14,311
Sir-- sir, may I proffer you a pamphlet?

588
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,148
And in the 1950s,

589
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:20,918
thousands of people protested to stop

590
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:22,786
the execution of the Rosenbergs.

591
00:29:24,455 --> 00:29:27,758
Of course, in the '60s, there was always a Vietnam demonstration.

592
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,093
Hell no, we won't go!

593
00:29:29,126 --> 00:29:31,695
Hell no, we won't go!

594
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,798
Hell no, we won't go! Hell no...

595
00:29:34,832 --> 00:29:38,002
Must've been pretty crazy to see your old boyfriend like that, huh?

596
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,838
How long were you guys together?

597
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:42,840
Over a year. We never lived together,

598
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,908
but we saw each other every night.

599
00:29:44,942 --> 00:29:48,746
I forgot how nice it felt seeing someone you love all the time.

600
00:29:50,147 --> 00:29:52,850
I wonder what Joey's parents think about me.

601
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,251
So what did you think of Stacy?

602
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:56,086
She's rather pale.

603
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,421
How do you mean?

604
00:29:57,454 --> 00:29:59,423
What your mother means is she's...

605
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:03,060
exceedingly white.

606
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,462
So you don't like her because of the color of her skin?

607
00:30:05,496 --> 00:30:06,463
Is that what you're telling me?

608
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:07,364
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

609
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:09,800
No, it's simply that she's not like us.

610
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,468
You mean wealthy, over-educated,

611
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:13,904
Upper-West-Side, paranoid, ghoul-chasing--

612
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,973
Oh, for fuck's sake. She's undead!

613
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:18,909
And I forbid you to see her!

614
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,277
You think everyone is a vampire.

615
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,354
Just because somebody stays up late,

616
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:22,422
doesn't go to bed before 3:00...

617
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,313
Well excuse me for being overly vigilant.

618
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:24,357
...doesn't mean hey can just grow fangs,

619
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:27,017
put on a black cape... But I think beings

620
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:29,062
devoid of warm blood... ...and fly around tow like a bat!

621
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:30,463
Just because they're a little peaky,

622
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:31,631
it doesn't mean they drink blood.

623
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,058
...roam the street at night looking for innocent victims.

624
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:35,759
You are so intolerant.

625
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,029
Enough! Stop it, both of you.

626
00:30:39,063 --> 00:30:41,899
Let's just invite your little friend to supper.

627
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:43,901
If she's one of them, we'll know.

628
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:45,502
Fine.

629
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,908
Tonight, we're meeting under sad circumstances.

630
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:53,277
I'm sure by now you've all heard about David's

631
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,512
tragic Daylight Savings accident.

632
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,982
Boy, one century you're here

633
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:00,751
and the next you're gone.

634
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,754
Do you sense something gross?

635
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,424
Yes.

636
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,826
I see we have a newcomer.

637
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:10,894
Uh, yeah, hi. I'm Rita.

638
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:12,362
Hi, Rita.

639
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:14,465
I am a psy-vampire.

640
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:19,837
What exactly is that? Psychic vampire.

641
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,140
I'm able to feed off other people's auras.

642
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,375
You know, I absorb their energy.

643
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:27,878
How do you know you're not just annoying them?

644
00:31:28,946 --> 00:31:32,216
Psy-vampires are a true vampiric subset, okay?

645
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,485
And we don't need blood to draw--

646
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,823
What the fuck is that?

647
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:44,128
All right, all right. Settle down.

648
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,896
We really gotta be more careful

649
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:47,931
about how we announce our meetings.

650
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:50,067
Anybody else have something to share?

651
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,169
Stacy got called in for jury duty,

652
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,204
but she hasn't voted since the '80s.

653
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:55,472
That happened to me.

654
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:57,407
And they're bringing me in for an audit.

655
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:59,076
Everybody call on your stems

656
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:00,978
and any human-feeders you know.

657
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:02,546
But how are we gonna find Cisserus?

658
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:03,914
You don't know her resting place?

659
00:32:03,947 --> 00:32:05,949
When she wants us, she summons us.

660
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,918
We never call on her.

661
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,086
Okay.

662
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,921
We all gotta work together, folks.

663
00:32:10,954 --> 00:32:13,357
The community is being persecuted.

664
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,526
I've seen it all before.

665
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,263
Now instead of tortures, they're using computers.

666
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:23,934
Does Mr. Davidoff know you are coming?

667
00:32:23,967 --> 00:32:26,503
Mr. Davidoff is aware

668
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:28,972
we'll be here between 7:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.

669
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:32,442
But don't you need a search warrant?

670
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:36,313
Madam, you've insultingly confused us with the police.

671
00:32:36,346 --> 00:32:38,015
I'm from Time Warner,

672
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:40,117
and if you ever want to see Jon Stewart again,

673
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,618
you'll open this door.

674
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:45,923
Let's get some light in here.

675
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:52,396
Morning, Sunshine.

676
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,156
Buenas noches, chicas.

677
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:20,691
Have you seen Ivan?

678
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,693
He hasn't answered any of my summonses.

679
00:33:22,726 --> 00:33:24,928
Uh, I think we saw him last week.

680
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,230
Something must have happened.

681
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:28,065
He's not strong enough to ignore you.

682
00:33:28,098 --> 00:33:31,101
Well, you chicas will just have to fill in.

683
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,971
But we're only good at modeling and light clerical work.

684
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:37,474
So, you fold these carefully,

685
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:39,943
and you pack this soil.

686
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,046
Don't you just love these "As-seen-on-TV" bags?

687
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:51,688
Look how much soil it can fit.

688
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:53,399
Oh, it's a good thing we're here because there's gonna be

689
00:33:53,423 --> 00:33:56,159
a big meeting with all the local stems and ELFs.

690
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:58,438
There's been a lot of persecution of the community.

691
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,697
What do I care? Well, if you keep acting

692
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:02,432
so recklessly, they're gonna find you.

693
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:05,702
No one will ever find my lair.

694
00:34:05,736 --> 00:34:09,373
And I'm in the one place no New Yorker ever goes.

695
00:34:09,406 --> 00:34:11,541
But your behavior makes it harder for everyone else.

696
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:13,110
For who?

697
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:15,512
For Vlad Tepish and his doofus peasants?

698
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:17,214
"Vlad the Impaler"?

699
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,750
I'll tell you what that whole impaling routine was.

700
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:21,618
Compensation.

701
00:34:21,652 --> 00:34:23,387
You know what I'm saying?

702
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,623
Besides, I am leaving town.

703
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:31,061
And look at this pimpin' travel coffin he made me.

704
00:34:32,596 --> 00:34:34,498
Here's the itinerary.

705
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,067
Just get me on cargo before dawn.

706
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,302
It's a private jet.

707
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:40,237
Spain? What's in Spain?

708
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,306
It is not just the rain in Spain.

709
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:44,174
Look at him.

710
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,076
Diego Bardem.

711
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,112
Only the handsomest, most talented man in the world.

712
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:52,115
Do you know him? No, I don't know him.

713
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:54,051
But I got mad love for him.

714
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:55,252
And I'll tell you a secret.

715
00:34:57,154 --> 00:35:00,691
I am not gonna use any hypnotism.

716
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,194
I want this to be real.

717
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:10,200
I haven't felt this way about anyone since Al Jolson.

718
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,501
The Mammy guy?

719
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,371
Yes, the Mammy guy.

720
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:17,207
I mean, he was an amazingly dynamic performer.

721
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,277
You have no idea because you never saw him live.

722
00:35:22,646 --> 00:35:24,181
No, no, no.

723
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,150
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

724
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:35,158
Hey.

725
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:38,195
What did your parents say about me?

726
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:40,397
Are you near your computer? Yeah.

727
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,665
Come on iChat. I wanna see you.

728
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,101
Oh!

729
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:47,070
I don't-- I don't have iChat.

730
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,839
Yeah, you do. It's built in.

731
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:51,274
Yeah, but my roommate was spray painting

732
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:53,176
and she got paint on the lens.

733
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,678
So... Pfft.

734
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:56,213
What did your parents say?

735
00:35:56,246 --> 00:35:59,082
They thought you were a bit pale.

736
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,352
What do you mean pale?

737
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,187
Well, you know, pale, fair skin.

738
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:06,390
Like maybe you were sick or something.

739
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:09,226
Well, it's just those environmental light bulbs.

740
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:10,570
I mean, they make everybody look horrible.

741
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:12,405
Look, they want you to come for dinner on Friday.

742
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:14,131
Can you make it?

743
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:15,565
Oh, I'll be there.

744
00:37:12,956 --> 00:37:15,592
Stay still.

745
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:23,667
It's good, right? I think it's totally working.

746
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,202
I'm gonna be so tan.

747
00:37:28,939 --> 00:37:30,373
Hi.

748
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,943
Wow. You look...

749
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:34,444
Robust?

750
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:36,947
Sure.

751
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,282
Come in. Dinner will be a few minutes.

752
00:37:39,316 --> 00:37:41,151
Let me give you the tour.

753
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:47,657
What is all this stuff?

754
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:49,559
Well, it's mostly stuff from my grandfather

755
00:37:49,593 --> 00:37:51,261
or my great grandfather.

756
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:54,464
My father is an expert on vampirism.

757
00:37:54,498 --> 00:37:56,299
Told you my family's nuts.

758
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,202
What's this thing? Ah, well...

759
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,738
if someone you suspect of being a vampire dies,

760
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:03,940
you place this over their neck before they're buried

761
00:38:03,974 --> 00:38:07,277
and if they wake up and try to climb out of their coffin,

762
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,846
they get beheaded.

763
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,748
Dinner's ready!

764
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:23,894
Hey, I know him.

765
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,529
You know him?

766
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:27,397
I mean, I know who he is.

767
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,266
It's Vlad Tepish.

768
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,401
It's pronounced "Tee-pees."

769
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,872
He was one of the most sadistic figures in history.

770
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:39,643
Well, I guess that sort of depends on your point of view.

771
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:41,311
Really?

772
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:43,480
How many points of view can there be on the subject

773
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:46,283
of impaling people and drinking their blood?

774
00:38:46,316 --> 00:38:48,518
If a weird stunt like that stops

775
00:38:48,552 --> 00:38:51,354
the entire Ottoman Empire from taking over Europe.

776
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:53,623
His armor is in the museum in Bucharest.

777
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:55,959
I mean, they consider him a hero.

778
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:59,362
Yeah, if it wasn't for him, we'd all be speaking "Ottomanese."

779
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:01,498
Didn't you like your fish?

780
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,300
Shall we make something else for you?

781
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,403
Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Van Helsing.

782
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:08,572
I'm enjoying my dinner a great deal.

783
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:12,609
Now, you must try our soup.

784
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,978
It's an old Van Helsing recipe.

785
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:21,718
Ahh!

786
00:39:21,751 --> 00:39:24,321
Not a fan of garlic?

787
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:26,923
Oh, no, it's not the garlic. It's the salt.

788
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:29,025
Even the tiniest bit and I blow up

789
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:31,494
like a Thanksgiving Day balloon.

790
00:39:31,528 --> 00:39:33,339
My father thinks that if he gives us garlic breath,

791
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:34,965
we won't make out.

792
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,000
Not going to work, Pops.

793
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:39,469
Ma, we'll take dessert later. The movie starts at 9:30.

794
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,937
I'll just get our things.

795
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,891
Hmm.

796
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:04,828
You have a very strong will, Dr. Van Helsing.

797
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,330
What are your intentions with my son?

798
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:08,498
What do you mean?

799
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,501
Do you plan to suck the life out of him?

800
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,337
No more than any other girlfriend.

801
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,073
Hey, you ready?

802
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,577
Thank you for dinner.

803
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,779
See you later.

804
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,683
Oh, I know. But did you see the girl

805
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,918
who left with Joey? Is she one of them?

806
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:30,487
I wasn't really paying attention.

807
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,088
That girl, she seemed pretty dark.

808
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:33,432
But it's all gonna be on my phone.

809
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:34,924
So hold on.

810
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:37,894
Wait, I don't remember seeing empty chairs.

811
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:39,696
What did I do wrong?

812
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,365
You didn't do anything wrong.

813
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,642
Why do people bother going out

814
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:54,477
if the only thing they want to bond with

815
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:55,688
is their little glowing boxes?

816
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:57,547
Don't go grandma on me.

817
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,516
Oh, there's Renfield. Hey.

818
00:40:59,549 --> 00:41:01,718
Uh, you guys, um...

819
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,587
kinda can't sit here unless we order a $400 bottle.

820
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:06,790
- Don't worry about it.
- Bottle service.

821
00:41:08,992 --> 00:41:11,928
She left him 10 minutes ago. The sex must be great.

822
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:14,097
Oh, we haven't done it yet.

823
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,433
Oh, so it's a purely textual relationship?

824
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,970
I've been looking for you, you lifeless bitch.

825
00:41:21,004 --> 00:41:22,572
What is your problem?

826
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,407
What did you do to Ivan?

827
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,909
What are you talking about?

828
00:41:28,011 --> 00:41:31,047
First you kill my game with Juicy girl.

829
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:32,982
Now Ivan is missing.

830
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:34,751
Suckerin' succotash.

831
00:41:36,653 --> 00:41:38,621
Guys, guys, guys!

832
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:40,423
Not in front of the day players.

833
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:43,593
The past few minutes, you remember nothing.

834
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,728
Complete Sergeant Schultz.

835
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,463
I know nothing!

836
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,432
I saw nothing! Now cut it out.

837
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,735
Besides, why would we hurt Ivan?

838
00:41:51,768 --> 00:41:54,137
We'd just wind up doing more work for Cisserus.

839
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:55,481
Actually, it's a good thing we ran into you.

840
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:58,007
We need you to come to a Sanguines Anonymous meeting.

841
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,143
No way. You don't have to join,

842
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:02,545
but a lot of weird stuff has been going down.

843
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,156
They're trying to force us out into the sun.

844
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,950
You think this has something to do with Ivan's disappearance?

845
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,485
It might.

846
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:11,154
Did anyone in his building see anything?

847
00:42:11,187 --> 00:42:13,456
The neighbor said the cable company was there.

848
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,126
Can Time Warner just burst into a person's home and kill them?

849
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,794
Yeah, they're terrible.

850
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,731
Come to a meeting. We've got to figure this out.

851
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:23,600
Everybody's getting audited.

852
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,101
Well, you don't have to go.

853
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:26,536
What?

854
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:28,471
An audit is just the IRS saying,

855
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,006
"We think you should pay more taxes."

856
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:32,051
And if you agree with them, then you say, "Okay, how much?"

857
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:34,878
But you only have to go in if you wanna challenge them.

858
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:36,546
How do you know this?

859
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,047
I'm a CPA.

860
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:39,582
You are? Yeah.

861
00:42:39,616 --> 00:42:41,050
You just got some new clients.

862
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:44,120
Not me. I have a guy.

863
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,001
What are you wearing?

864
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,803
It's like the history of fashion.

865
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:03,640
I'm going to see Danny. I wanna look nice.

866
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:05,642
Gibson Girl shirts were the prettiest.

867
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:08,511
1960s skirts are great on short women.

868
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,881
1970s shoes make you tall but are comfortable.

869
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:13,750
Okay, but what's with the hat?

870
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:15,185
It's a boater.

871
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,020
People always said it looked spiffy on me.

872
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,122
People from your barbershop quartet

873
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:21,591
or people from the Republican convention?

874
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,593
Oh, God.

875
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,696
Here we are.

876
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,032
"Architectural Digest" time. Enjoy yourself.

877
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,633
Sure you don't want anything to drink?

878
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:32,202
I'm sure. Well, I'm not.

879
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,204
I need some coffee, man. For energy.

880
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,041
I just made this last week.

881
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,076
Oh. You work for the government?

882
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:42,111
Do I look like I work for the government?

883
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:43,780
I'm with the ACLU.

884
00:43:43,813 --> 00:43:46,583
Right now I'm in the middle of this deportation case

885
00:43:46,616 --> 00:43:50,220
with abuses of wiretapping. It's unbearable.

886
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,121
Well, I thought if the government

887
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:53,723
doesn't hear terrorist-related stuff,

888
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,891
they have to hang up.

889
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,659
No.

890
00:43:57,727 --> 00:43:59,062
Ah, look at this.

891
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,055
I was going through these looking for your mother.

892
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,668
Look at these.

893
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:07,737
She had this habit of just

894
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,140
ducking out right before they took a picture.

895
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:13,176
Well, she was superstitious.

896
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:14,978
Still, I mean, it's a little nutty, isn't it?

897
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:16,613
My God.

898
00:44:16,646 --> 00:44:18,581
I have this one. You do? Really?

899
00:44:18,615 --> 00:44:20,617
She saved it?

900
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,218
You better put yours in plastic.

901
00:44:22,252 --> 00:44:24,320
She liked this, huh? Well, why not?

902
00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:26,589
I was not bad-looking back then, huh?

903
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:29,926
What an amazing time this was.

904
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,862
Being young and in love.

905
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:35,565
Feeling like you're a part of something that really mattered.

906
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:39,669
Your mother never mentioned why she just disappeared?

907
00:44:39,702 --> 00:44:42,338
Not really. Oh, man.

908
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:43,973
Hey, you know what?

909
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:47,777
I have to get movies for my wife before the store closes.

910
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,246
Right on. Huh?

911
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,181
My way.

912
00:44:52,215 --> 00:44:54,684
I'll go with. Oh.

913
00:44:54,717 --> 00:44:56,019
All right, cool.

914
00:44:56,052 --> 00:44:58,154
You know, Angela is really in and out.

915
00:44:58,187 --> 00:45:00,924
And that's why I gotta get her movies that she really loves.

916
00:45:00,957 --> 00:45:02,759
So, you know, when she dozes off,

917
00:45:02,792 --> 00:45:04,627
you know, she won't miss anything, really.

918
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,729
Can I help? Uh, no.

919
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:08,231
When I see 'em, I'll know it.

920
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:10,767
Then I'm gonna look around. Okay, cool.

921
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,271
Excuse me.

922
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:17,106
Do you have any James Cagney posters?

923
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,641
Oh, James Cameron?

924
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,412
No, uh, James Cagney.

925
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:24,948
You know, "Made it, Ma! Top of the world!"

926
00:45:24,981 --> 00:45:26,816
No.

927
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,318
What about...

928
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,186
Fred Astaire? No.

929
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:31,888
Jack Lemmon? No.

930
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:35,091
Paul Newman. Oh, the salad dressing guy?

931
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,829
Yeah. No.

932
00:45:45,435 --> 00:45:46,970
Phones on the ground.

933
00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:50,139
Phones on the ground now. Drop 'em!

934
00:45:50,173 --> 00:45:52,084
Hands in the air. Hands in the air. Give me the money.

935
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:53,686
Don't you point that. He's got a heart condition.

936
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,678
Shut up! Oh, my God!

937
00:45:55,712 --> 00:45:57,447
Fuck. Come on!

938
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,282
He's having a heart attack. No, no, no, lady.

939
00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:00,783
Get up and give me the money now.

940
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:03,052
Shit, come on! Oh!

941
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,123
Stop it.

942
00:46:07,156 --> 00:46:08,358
Calm down.

943
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:21,804
Mm. Feel better?

944
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:23,706
Yeah.

945
00:46:24,941 --> 00:46:26,781
You are gonna take this couple to the hospital.

946
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:28,378
And no more stealing.

947
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,846
The bite was from your cat.

948
00:46:29,879 --> 00:46:32,281
You guys, take CPR courses.

949
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:34,884
You hate junk food.

950
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,753
And get "Public Enemy."

951
00:46:36,786 --> 00:46:38,855
The Cagney one.

952
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,158
You all right?

953
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:45,762
I could hypnotize you,

954
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:49,832
but I've been wanting to tell you.

955
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:51,076
So what are you saying? You broke up with me 'cause

956
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,445
you wouldn't drink my blood? Is that what you're telling me?

957
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:56,139
I don't drink human blood.

958
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:59,108
You don't? That guy, what was that?

959
00:46:59,142 --> 00:47:02,478
No. Have you ever seen a vampire bat?

960
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:07,350
A little rodent can get the blood out of an entire cow

961
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:10,286
in a few minutes because of this enzyme in their saliva.

962
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,789
It's a completely safe blood thinner.

963
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:14,257
And I also have it.

964
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,759
I didn't drink that man's blood.

965
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,796
I spit into him to stop the stroke.

966
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:22,432
Oh. You just spit into him.

967
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,400
Oh, that's a whole other ball game.

968
00:47:24,434 --> 00:47:27,303
Well, if I didn't, he would have had a lot of brain damage.

969
00:47:27,336 --> 00:47:28,905
How old are you?

970
00:47:31,007 --> 00:47:32,508
A little older than you.

971
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,111
So people can only be around you for, like, what--

972
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,345
a year or something?

973
00:47:36,379 --> 00:47:38,247
No, I could go around seven years

974
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:40,283
without them expecting me to look older.

975
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,820
And I would've stayed with you for as long as possible.

976
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:45,788
But when you became one of the student leaders,

977
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,558
people on the street recognized you.

978
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:51,961
I thought, "This is his time."

979
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,498
You could have your choice of any woman out there.

980
00:47:55,531 --> 00:47:57,467
It didn't seem right to rob you of the chance

981
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,368
to meet someone amazing.

982
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,840
And you did, didn't you?

983
00:48:03,873 --> 00:48:06,342
I did. I really did.

984
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:08,111
And you know what? I really should check

985
00:48:08,144 --> 00:48:10,113
and see how she's doing.

986
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:11,490
And I gotta tell you something else.

987
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,417
I feel like I'm really, like, tripping right now.

988
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:16,853
Am I gonna see you again?

989
00:48:16,886 --> 00:48:19,088
Uh...

990
00:48:19,122 --> 00:48:21,524
of course, yeah.

991
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,883
Okay, this is Germany before World War II.

992
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,052
The sleepwalker keeps murdering people,

993
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,221
but only because the evil guy has him under a spell.

994
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,423
What does that remind you of?

995
00:49:28,491 --> 00:49:30,226
I'm flummoxed.

996
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,995
Germany? Evil spell?

997
00:49:33,029 --> 00:49:34,397
Adolf?

998
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,199
Your eyes remind me of somebody.

999
00:49:36,232 --> 00:49:38,100
Adolf Hitler.

1000
00:49:38,134 --> 00:49:40,069
No, that wasn't who I was thinking of.

1001
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,072
Audrey Hepburn. Same initials, though.

1002
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,942
Can you please just focus on symbolism?

1003
00:49:45,975 --> 00:49:47,910
Sorry.

1004
00:49:49,078 --> 00:49:51,013
Can I be under your spell?

1005
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,915
Or better still, you could be under my spell.

1006
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:54,517
What are you gonna make me do?

1007
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,652
Laugh hysterically.

1008
00:50:18,174 --> 00:50:21,043
Holy shit.

1009
00:50:21,077 --> 00:50:23,546
Has it ever been like that for your before?

1010
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,681
Not since the '80s.

1011
00:50:35,424 --> 00:50:37,126
Hey, where are you going?

1012
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,327
Um, I've got an early class.

1013
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:40,096
Well, ditch it and come back to bed.

1014
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:43,232
I can't. But I'll call you later.

1015
00:50:43,266 --> 00:50:45,110
Come on, my parents won't be home until tomorrow.

1016
00:50:45,134 --> 00:50:47,970
Look, it's a little early in the relationship to get into this,

1017
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:49,372
but I've really gotta go.

1018
00:51:02,385 --> 00:51:04,120
What the--

1019
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:12,495
Something bothering you? What?

1020
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:14,997
No.

1021
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:19,435
If there's anything you wanna talk about...

1022
00:51:19,468 --> 00:51:22,171
maybe trouble with Stacy, or...

1023
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:28,044
Yeah, 'cause you'd love that.

1024
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:31,113
He's not answering my texts, my tweets, my e-mails,

1025
00:51:31,147 --> 00:51:32,324
my voicemail, my Facebook messages--

1026
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:34,016
Do you think he'll tell his father?

1027
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:36,052
No, he wouldn't do that. What about Danny?

1028
00:51:36,085 --> 00:51:37,329
Do you think he'll tell the authorities?

1029
00:51:37,353 --> 00:51:39,488
He'd never. How do you know?

1030
00:51:39,522 --> 00:51:41,023
Danny hates authority.

1031
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,057
I'm gonna go to his class so he has to confront me.

1032
00:51:45,528 --> 00:51:47,063
Are you mad at me?

1033
00:51:48,464 --> 00:51:50,132
Don't go away. Huh? What?

1034
00:51:54,136 --> 00:51:56,105
Really? Yeah.

1035
00:51:57,173 --> 00:51:59,175
How do you like them apples?

1036
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:01,243
Garlic?

1037
00:52:01,277 --> 00:52:02,454
You were afraid of it the other night.

1038
00:52:02,478 --> 00:52:05,014
Yeah, because I've always hated garlic.

1039
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:08,250
Can we please just talk about this?

1040
00:52:08,284 --> 00:52:11,220
My father tried to warn me. Against what?

1041
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,489
I have never harmed a human being or a domestic animal

1042
00:52:13,522 --> 00:52:15,191
my entire life.

1043
00:52:15,224 --> 00:52:17,560
Oh, so you didn't go after me 'cause I'm a Van Helsing?

1044
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:20,229
No. If anything, I would've stayed away.

1045
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,773
Besides, if I wanted to drink your blood,

1046
00:52:21,797 --> 00:52:24,367
would I have written you this 10-page report

1047
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,603
on Freud and his influence on surrealist imagery?

1048
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,410
How do I know you wrote this for me?

1049
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,213
Because I also wrote one on World War I

1050
00:52:37,246 --> 00:52:39,382
and how it gave birth to Surrealism.

1051
00:52:39,415 --> 00:52:41,117
Actually, I like that one better.

1052
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,752
Oh, you do?

1053
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,221
So now you trust me, huh?

1054
00:52:45,254 --> 00:52:46,498
I trust you to give yourself the better grade.

1055
00:52:46,522 --> 00:52:48,090
I don't blame you.

1056
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,168
You know I would never hurt you, right?

1057
00:52:59,201 --> 00:53:01,270
Yeah.

1058
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,172
Well, then what is it? Is it the day thing?

1059
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:04,807
Do you want to have a girlfriend

1060
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,518
you can go hiking with and go to the beach?

1061
00:53:06,542 --> 00:53:09,879
No, I'm-- I'm more of a night person.

1062
00:53:09,912 --> 00:53:11,113
Is it the blood, then?

1063
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:15,151
You wanna try new restaurants? No, I'm not much of a foodie.

1064
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:16,652
So what is it?

1065
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:21,223
I hate it when my parents are right.

1066
00:53:42,812 --> 00:53:45,181
Okay, now open.

1067
00:53:47,883 --> 00:53:49,385
Thank you!

1068
00:53:49,418 --> 00:53:51,587
You know what? I'm sorry. No, no, no, no.

1069
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,856
I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.

1070
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,326
Fine. Yay!

1071
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,332
Come on, just sign the petition.

1072
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,367
Okay. Okay.

1073
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:09,338
Here you go. Right there.

1074
00:54:39,835 --> 00:54:41,770
Ooh.

1075
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:46,308
Hey, Renfield. Come on in. Hey. How are you, Goody?

1076
00:54:46,342 --> 00:54:48,310
Jesus.

1077
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:50,346
Hey, Renfield. Hey, how are you?

1078
00:54:50,379 --> 00:54:52,648
Do you mind if I smoke? Yes.

1079
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,783
But-- I mean, this can't bother you.

1080
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:57,920
It bothers me if you're hurting yourself.

1081
00:54:57,953 --> 00:54:59,522
Well, then awaken me.

1082
00:54:59,555 --> 00:55:01,690
It doesn't work that way.

1083
00:55:01,724 --> 00:55:03,292
You're an accountant. Do the math.

1084
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:04,627
If every infected person

1085
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,296
fed on or infected the rest of the people,

1086
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:10,299
the entire population would've eaten itself off the planet

1087
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:12,535
long before Christ was even born.

1088
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:15,237
Only a stem can turn someone.

1089
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,772
Is that the sweater Tepish knit you?

1090
00:55:16,805 --> 00:55:18,607
Mm-hmm. It would be impolite not to wear it.

1091
00:55:18,641 --> 00:55:20,376
And it goes with everything.

1092
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:22,411
Wait till you see the one he's making you.

1093
00:55:24,346 --> 00:55:26,415
Okay, people.

1094
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,317
This is an amazing event.

1095
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,553
Except for Cisserus, we have all the stems

1096
00:55:30,586 --> 00:55:32,788
from the tri-state area.

1097
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:35,791
Vadim the Russian, Ukrainian.

1098
00:55:35,824 --> 00:55:38,394
- Ashwan from Kush.
- Hi, Ashwan.

1099
00:55:38,427 --> 00:55:41,263
- Ghuri, the Turkish stem.
- Hi, Ghuri.

1100
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:42,565
Yuppa, yuppa.

1101
00:55:42,598 --> 00:55:44,333
I'd like to start by asking,

1102
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:46,969
how many of you have gotten subpoenas?

1103
00:55:50,072 --> 00:55:51,473
Excuse me.

1104
00:55:51,507 --> 00:55:55,344
Why do not we just eat the lawyers?

1105
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:58,714
You crazy. We can't eat all the lawyers.

1106
00:55:58,747 --> 00:56:00,349
Why not?

1107
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:02,427
Let's just say eating lawyers is out of the question.

1108
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:03,728
I know you can sense

1109
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:05,788
that we have day players among us.

1110
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,990
This is my granddaughter, Sarah.

1111
00:56:08,023 --> 00:56:08,991
Hi, Sarah.

1112
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:10,459
And this is our friend Renfield.

1113
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,728
He's a CPA so he can help with the IRS stuff.

1114
00:56:12,761 --> 00:56:15,998
And I understand we have a lawyer here.

1115
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:17,600
You absolutely do.

1116
00:56:17,633 --> 00:56:20,035
How you doin'? My name is Danny.

1117
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:22,671
Hi, Danny. And I'm from the ACLU.

1118
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:24,940
From what I understand, you can't be forced out

1119
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:27,810
during the day and you don't want anyone to molest

1120
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,812
your resting places.

1121
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,581
But the government can enter your home any time they want

1122
00:56:32,615 --> 00:56:34,016
because of the Patriot Act.

1123
00:56:34,049 --> 00:56:36,085
See what's going down now

1124
00:56:36,118 --> 00:56:39,488
is that all your cell phones and your iPhones

1125
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,924
and all the computers are helping them find you.

1126
00:56:41,957 --> 00:56:46,061
So I urge you not to use any of your electronic devices.

1127
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:48,664
How will we do anything?

1128
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,499
How do we even stay in touch with each other?

1129
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,635
I used to write things down.

1130
00:56:52,668 --> 00:56:55,871
Oh, yeah. Like in a datebook. Right.

1131
00:56:55,904 --> 00:56:58,540
But I need my computer to tell me sunrise and sunset.

1132
00:56:58,574 --> 00:57:00,709
Oh, I can tell everyone that on my almanac.

1133
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,483
Under "Sky Watch," it's got phases of the moon,

1134
00:57:07,516 --> 00:57:11,387
high tide, sunrise and sunset, and-- good Lord!

1135
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,721
What? What is it?

1136
00:57:12,755 --> 00:57:15,557
Total eclipse of the sun in two weeks.

1137
00:57:15,591 --> 00:57:16,835
Hold on, hold on.

1138
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:18,961
2:10 to 3:40.

1139
00:57:18,994 --> 00:57:20,805
Too bad that wasn't the exact time of our summons.

1140
00:57:20,829 --> 00:57:22,798
If we had face time, we could use hypnotism.

1141
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,001
No, why? That wouldn't make any difference.

1142
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:28,146
Couldn't we just change the times of the appointments?

1143
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,806
Yeah. We could get you completely eliminated

1144
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:32,608
from their system. We could delete and change

1145
00:57:32,641 --> 00:57:33,976
everything in their computers.

1146
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:36,378
You know, I can see why

1147
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,080
you have sworn off human blood.

1148
00:57:38,113 --> 00:57:39,982
Awesome. Do you want to join?

1149
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:42,084
How would you ladies like to be my wives?

1150
00:57:42,117 --> 00:57:43,719
Eat me.

1151
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,588
All right. Not literally.

1152
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,169
Oh, are you okay?

1153
00:58:00,202 --> 00:58:02,571
You were sick yesterday, too.

1154
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,475
Look what I got you.

1155
00:58:06,508 --> 00:58:08,444
Pure pharmaceutical grade.

1156
00:58:08,477 --> 00:58:10,546
Oh, but they're so cute.

1157
00:58:10,579 --> 00:58:13,582
They're not like vermin. They could be somebody's pets. Hi!

1158
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,060
I figured they wouldn't make you sick.

1159
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,885
It's nothing. I'm fine.

1160
00:58:16,919 --> 00:58:19,555
It's just when I get up.

1161
00:58:19,588 --> 00:58:21,924
Quit futzing. We have to go.

1162
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:25,728
Oh, don't start with me.

1163
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:28,564
Drop waists are coming back. Yeah, says who?

1164
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:30,733
I saw a picture of Keira Knightley in one.

1165
00:58:30,766 --> 00:58:32,201
Yeah, right.

1166
00:58:32,234 --> 00:58:34,570
That's because Keira Knightley's in a movie.

1167
00:58:34,603 --> 00:58:37,573
Ha, look at you! I know.

1168
00:58:37,606 --> 00:58:39,708
This was my college interview outfit.

1169
00:58:39,742 --> 00:58:41,610
Were you trying for a football scholarship?

1170
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:44,480
Ha-ha. It's the only thing I have that looks respectful.

1171
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,117
- Whoa, check it out.
- I know, it's crazy.

1172
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:52,087
Mom, look! I've never seen it before.

1173
00:58:52,121 --> 00:58:56,091
Don't look directly at it, honey.

1174
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,927
Wow, I totally forgot what it was like.

1175
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:01,230
It's an entirely different world.

1176
00:59:01,263 --> 00:59:03,599
Oh, so many women.

1177
00:59:03,632 --> 00:59:04,967
Have a nice day.

1178
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,536
Come on, everybody. Let's go. We only have two hours.

1179
00:59:07,569 --> 00:59:09,772
Hey, so do you know where we're going?

1180
00:59:09,805 --> 00:59:11,116
You will do what my accountant says.

1181
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,441
It's CPA.

1182
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,516
Okay, this is Ghuri.

1183
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:22,651
This is file number 318.

1184
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,520
This Vlad Tepish.

1185
00:59:24,553 --> 00:59:26,822
He was granted asylum in, um...

1186
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,024
1583.

1187
00:59:29,057 --> 00:59:32,561
Currently married to a US citizen.

1188
00:59:32,594 --> 00:59:34,663
Well, four.

1189
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,731
Yeah, that's okay.

1190
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:37,800
Child of an American fiancée.

1191
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,501
For an adjustment of status.

1192
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:42,571
A student visa so he can matriculate at UCLA.

1193
00:59:42,604 --> 00:59:43,906
Go Bruins.

1194
00:59:43,939 --> 00:59:45,474
Yeah.

1195
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:53,749
Stacy Daimer is unable to perform jury duty obligations.

1196
00:59:53,782 --> 00:59:56,552
Unable to perform jury duty obligations.

1197
00:59:56,585 --> 00:59:58,754
In fact, I'll just delete them. Just delete them.

1198
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:00,589
Put the deleted names in the trash.

1199
01:00:00,622 --> 01:00:01,824
Deleted names in trash.

1200
01:00:01,857 --> 01:00:03,192
Empty the trash. Empty the trash.

1201
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:06,528
Ask the IT guy to remove the hard drive.

1202
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:09,231
Go, go, go! Excuse us, coming through!

1203
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,556
Joey!

1204
01:00:51,974 --> 01:00:54,243
Yeah!

1205
01:00:58,614 --> 01:01:00,616
Let me see. Open.

1206
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:04,653
Hold it up. Hold it up.

1207
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:06,355
Aw, beautiful color.

1208
01:01:06,388 --> 01:01:09,925
They're having the book launch party for The Situation

1209
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,827
right now on 10th. What do you say?

1210
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,295
Ugh. Not worth the candle.

1211
01:01:13,328 --> 01:01:14,763
We're happy here.

1212
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,965
Every A-lister in New York will be there.

1213
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,834
You can have whoever you want.

1214
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:20,869
Mm. You get tired of that.

1215
01:01:22,738 --> 01:01:24,306
Oh, I like this song.

1216
01:01:24,339 --> 01:01:25,874
You wanna dance. Yeah, do you?

1217
01:01:25,908 --> 01:01:27,776
Yeah. Okay.

1218
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,317
Aren't you gonna dance?

1219
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,685
Me? I don't think so.

1220
01:01:36,718 --> 01:01:39,788
I'm not very good, no. Yes, you are.

1221
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,790
I remember. Yeah, but I don't remember.

1222
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:54,670
Do you sleep with henchmen?

1223
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,299
Joey had to go. His dad is bugging out.

1224
01:02:24,333 --> 01:02:26,134
Problems at work, no doubt.

1225
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,705
Hmm. Wonder who that could be.

1226
01:02:29,738 --> 01:02:31,974
Oh, isn't it insane?

1227
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:33,809
I was dating for 25 years

1228
01:02:33,842 --> 01:02:36,878
and I've never imagined to feel this way about somebody.

1229
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:38,714
What about you and Danny?

1230
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:40,916
Mm, I never stopped loving him.

1231
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:43,952
But his wife's sick so there's no even thinking about it.

1232
01:02:43,986 --> 01:02:45,787
I'm just happy around him.

1233
01:02:45,821 --> 01:02:47,356
Reminds me of being hopeful.

1234
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,992
But how great would it be if we both had relationships?

1235
01:02:50,025 --> 01:02:51,860
I mean, wouldn't it be so cool--

1236
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,228
Mott Street.

1237
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:55,263
Mott Street. Oh!

1238
01:02:55,297 --> 01:02:57,032
What is she doing back so soon?

1239
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,767
I guess things didn't work out with Diego.

1240
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,035
Ugh. She's in Chinatown.

1241
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,437
God, just when things were going so well.

1242
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:06,808
Mm.

1243
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:08,844
Oh-- oh, God.

1244
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:12,881
I've never seen real dead people.

1245
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,149
What did you do?

1246
01:03:14,182 --> 01:03:15,917
You know how it is

1247
01:03:15,951 --> 01:03:18,320
when you eat Chinese.

1248
01:03:18,353 --> 01:03:20,889
Half an hour later you're hungry again.

1249
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,791
How could you?

1250
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:26,862
Oh, I just can't stop eating.

1251
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:28,263
I'm so depressed.

1252
01:03:28,296 --> 01:03:30,732
Why didn't he like me?

1253
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:33,835
I am so much more bomb-ass than his girlfriend.

1254
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:36,204
Maybe she wasn't a homicidal maniac.

1255
01:03:36,238 --> 01:03:37,472
Maybe.

1256
01:03:37,506 --> 01:03:39,908
This is disgusting!

1257
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,076
I know.

1258
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,779
I could so easily hate myself.

1259
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:46,915
But just because you overdid it one day,

1260
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,751
doesn't mean you have to be bad all weekend.

1261
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,262
What's wrong with him?

1262
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,956
Finish him off, will ya?

1263
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,328
I said kill him.

1264
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,776
You really can't kill.

1265
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:18,013
You guys are so useless.

1266
01:04:18,046 --> 01:04:19,848
Forget it.

1267
01:04:21,249 --> 01:04:24,753
Hey, can I have a fortune cookie, at least?

1268
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,468
That was way too close.

1269
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,002
And I didn't put in rollers.

1270
01:04:41,036 --> 01:04:42,537
I'm gonna have coffin hair tomorrow.

1271
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:44,239
I know.

1272
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:45,941
Goody, I don't think

1273
01:04:45,974 --> 01:04:47,976
I can do anything like that again.

1274
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,478
Me either.

1275
01:04:56,551 --> 01:04:59,354
The world changes, we have to adapt.

1276
01:04:59,387 --> 01:05:01,256
These violent old ways

1277
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:03,058
don't make any sense anymore.

1278
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:05,360
But she won't listen.

1279
01:05:05,393 --> 01:05:08,964
She's insane. Oh, tell me about it.

1280
01:05:11,066 --> 01:05:13,435
Tepish, is there anything like a...

1281
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:15,303
Sanguine's doctor?

1282
01:05:15,337 --> 01:05:16,905
Stacy is sick.

1283
01:05:16,938 --> 01:05:18,840
That's impossible. We don't get sick.

1284
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:19,774
That's what I thought,

1285
01:05:19,808 --> 01:05:22,210
but every night when we get up, she vomits.

1286
01:05:22,244 --> 01:05:25,180
Just how old was she when she was awakened?

1287
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,915
20.

1288
01:05:26,948 --> 01:05:28,483
And I assume there is a boyfriend.

1289
01:05:28,517 --> 01:05:30,185
Why?

1290
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,254
She's not sick. She's pregnant.

1291
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:34,422
So she can have a baby?

1292
01:05:34,456 --> 01:05:37,392
No, the pregnancy will end by itself.

1293
01:05:37,425 --> 01:05:39,427
Unless she turns back.

1294
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:41,930
Like, if Cisserus dies?

1295
01:05:41,963 --> 01:05:44,332
Cisserus.

1296
01:05:44,366 --> 01:05:47,035
Don't you worry, hmm?

1297
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:50,105
Stacy will be just fine in about a week.

1298
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,909
They notified us about a patient having seizures

1299
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:55,987
who had a double puncture wound. When I asked who checked him in,

1300
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:58,180
I went back to their surveillance cameras.

1301
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:00,048
Where's the body? Mount Sinai.

1302
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,617
Tell them we're coming. Mm-hmm.

1303
01:06:02,651 --> 01:06:06,621
All right, sit down, listen to me.

1304
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:09,591
Now, I know you think I'm crazy,

1305
01:06:09,624 --> 01:06:12,460
but you have to do something for me.

1306
01:06:12,494 --> 01:06:13,628
Sure.

1307
01:06:13,662 --> 01:06:15,664
Carry this with you at all times.

1308
01:06:15,697 --> 01:06:18,667
What? This is how you load it.

1309
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:20,902
Only use the silver bullets.

1310
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:22,604
Only use them on what? Stacy?

1311
01:06:22,637 --> 01:06:24,439
Just keep it with you.

1312
01:06:24,472 --> 01:06:26,942
Don't give me any shit.

1313
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:31,012
When a problem comes along, like hunger, you must whip it.

1314
01:06:31,046 --> 01:06:34,082
It says this guy's a comic? He's not even funny.

1315
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,517
I've never seen him in anything.

1316
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,185
What's on?

1317
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:39,521
"Assholes Insult People More Talented Than Them."

1318
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:43,058
"The Excessively '80s Countdown."

1319
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:44,326
Oh, show Goody.

1320
01:06:44,359 --> 01:06:45,961
Oh.

1321
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:49,564
So my father decided to give me this.

1322
01:06:49,598 --> 01:06:51,166
Hmm. That's weird.

1323
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:52,543
Oh, careful. It's got silver bullets in it.

1324
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,538
What's he thinking?

1325
01:06:56,571 --> 01:06:58,473
He's got more paranoid

1326
01:06:58,506 --> 01:07:00,084
since he saw the footage from the hospital.

1327
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:01,977
What footage?

1328
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:05,046
This guy just seemed to fly from a cab to the front door.

1329
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,581
I'm such an idiot.

1330
01:07:06,615 --> 01:07:08,984
Why didn't I look for surveillance cameras?

1331
01:07:09,017 --> 01:07:10,995
Wait a minute, you-- No, no. We didn't do anything.

1332
01:07:11,019 --> 01:07:13,955
It was-- it was our stem, Cisserus.

1333
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:16,024
She's a monster.

1334
01:07:16,057 --> 01:07:18,126
She's gonna louse it up for all of us.

1335
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,629
Don't trip. We'll talk to Tepish.

1336
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:23,098
Oh, I saw him after work

1337
01:07:23,131 --> 01:07:25,000
and he said you'll be feeling better soon.

1338
01:07:25,033 --> 01:07:26,534
You're just pregnant.

1339
01:07:26,568 --> 01:07:29,304
What?

1340
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,406
I'm pregnant? We're gonna have a baby.

1341
01:07:31,439 --> 01:07:33,141
I'm pregnant!

1342
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,110
Oh, my God!

1343
01:07:35,143 --> 01:07:36,678
Oh, I can't believe this. I'm pregnant?

1344
01:07:36,711 --> 01:07:38,413
You want a baby?

1345
01:07:38,446 --> 01:07:40,282
Well...

1346
01:07:40,315 --> 01:07:42,617
yeah.

1347
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:45,120
I'm over 40. How many more chances am I gonna get?

1348
01:07:45,153 --> 01:07:46,664
And besides, I'll make a kick-ass father.

1349
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,232
All right.

1350
01:07:48,256 --> 01:07:50,558
Forget cell phones, forget iPhones,

1351
01:07:50,592 --> 01:07:53,361
forget PowerBooks, forget iPads.

1352
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:55,063
Yay.

1353
01:07:55,096 --> 01:07:57,699
Now I can do everything I want

1354
01:07:57,732 --> 01:07:59,601
with my iPad Mini.

1355
01:07:59,634 --> 01:08:01,236
That looks just like your phone.

1356
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:03,038
But it doesn't make calls.

1357
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:05,173
I got my tweets, I got my e-mails,

1358
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,617
I got my friends, I got my alerts, I got--

1359
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:08,543
So as the day progresses, you can read

1360
01:08:08,576 --> 01:08:11,146
thousands of unsolicited messages,

1361
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:15,083
advertisements, and the mindless brain vomit of acquaintances?

1362
01:08:15,116 --> 01:08:16,785
Someone sounds hormonal.

1363
01:08:16,818 --> 01:08:18,353
Maybe you're pregnant, too!

1364
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,322
So annoying.

1365
01:08:20,355 --> 01:08:23,024
You have to keep learning to use new crap

1366
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:24,693
that doesn't actually do anything better

1367
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,195
than the old crap, which is incompatible with the new crap,

1368
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,065
all so you can have blogs and watch fake teenagers

1369
01:08:30,098 --> 01:08:31,766
and real housewives?

1370
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,669
And it's all happening too fast

1371
01:08:34,703 --> 01:08:36,538
and I'm tired.

1372
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:40,542
I'm just sick and tired of it all.

1373
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,211
It's okay.

1374
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:45,180
We don't have to get the iPad Minis.

1375
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:50,452
No, I'm sorry...

1376
01:08:50,485 --> 01:08:53,321
Look. Only a couple stations, but they had Groucho Marx.

1377
01:08:53,355 --> 01:08:55,357
No, that's not Groucho.

1378
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,092
Groucho was the mustache guy.

1379
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,502
Yeah, he had glasses and a cigar.

1380
01:08:58,526 --> 01:09:00,428
Yeah, a cigar and glasses.

1381
01:09:00,462 --> 01:09:02,263
You'll split $25 between you. Are you ready?

1382
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:04,065
Yes. Who is buried in Grant's Tomb?

1383
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,734
Were people really that stupid?

1384
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:08,236
No, that's what he'd ask when he felt bad

1385
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:09,671
and wanted to give 'em a few bucks.

1386
01:09:09,704 --> 01:09:11,373
Is Grant's Tomb in New York?

1387
01:09:11,406 --> 01:09:13,475
No. No. Yeah. Yeah.

1388
01:09:13,508 --> 01:09:15,243
Have any of you ever been there?

1389
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,212
No. No.

1390
01:09:17,245 --> 01:09:20,081
- That's it.
- What?

1391
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:23,685
God, the place no New Yorker ever goes.

1392
01:09:23,718 --> 01:09:26,187
Of course, Cisserus would want a monument.

1393
01:09:26,221 --> 01:09:27,589
And it's got a tomb.

1394
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,424
Oh, my God. You're probably right.

1395
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,059
Come on.

1396
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,397
Show me again. Yeah, here.

1397
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,799
I guess I totally can tell, but it's--

1398
01:09:37,832 --> 01:09:39,477
it's like, I don't know. I always thought you'd be

1399
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:41,236
the first one to have a baby. Is that weird?

1400
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:42,771
But now that it's happening-- Listen.

1401
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:46,141
You have to decide something independent of me or Joey.

1402
01:09:46,174 --> 01:09:49,244
This baby won't survive in your condition.

1403
01:09:49,277 --> 01:09:51,646
If you want it, you have to turn back.

1404
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,214
How does that even--

1405
01:09:53,248 --> 01:09:55,116
Cisserus would have to be killed.

1406
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:56,484
That's right.

1407
01:09:56,518 --> 01:09:59,654
I'd be in my '40s.

1408
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:01,122
But I'd be a mom.

1409
01:10:02,924 --> 01:10:06,327
You'd be older, too. I know.

1410
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:07,896
I can't decide for the both of us.

1411
01:10:07,929 --> 01:10:11,599
How do you feel about not being young anymore?

1412
01:10:11,633 --> 01:10:13,134
Which part--

1413
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:16,171
running around to clubs and dating idiots?

1414
01:10:16,204 --> 01:10:19,140
Would be nice not to have to fake all the references.

1415
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,575
Ugh. Like acting nostalgic over

1416
01:10:20,608 --> 01:10:23,144
"Hey, Arnold" instead of "Happy Days."

1417
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:25,346
Not to mention the slang, "BTW."

1418
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:27,248
And the clothes and the music.

1419
01:10:27,282 --> 01:10:29,884
Staying young is getting old.

1420
01:10:29,918 --> 01:10:33,221
Plus, we'll have a baby.

1421
01:10:35,223 --> 01:10:38,193
What are we even talking about? We can't kill Cisserus.

1422
01:10:38,226 --> 01:10:39,828
She's lasted hundreds of years.

1423
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,330
But that's because nobody knew where she was.

1424
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,398
But she's very sturdy.

1425
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:45,733
And let's face it, we're wimps.

1426
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:49,170
Yeah, but she's sloppy. And conceited.

1427
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:50,672
And we'll call in the heavy-hitters.

1428
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:52,273
Who?

1429
01:10:52,307 --> 01:10:54,242
Your future father-in-law.

1430
01:10:56,578 --> 01:10:59,314
I just have to do one thing first.

1431
01:10:59,347 --> 01:11:01,749
You said for a little more time, you'd do anything.

1432
01:11:01,783 --> 01:11:04,319
Did you mean it? Of course, but what can I do?

1433
01:11:04,352 --> 01:11:06,321
Would you change your schedule and stay up later

1434
01:11:06,354 --> 01:11:08,623
and promise to let her only have animals?

1435
01:11:08,656 --> 01:11:11,392
Now, wait a minute. Can you keep her alive?

1436
01:11:11,426 --> 01:11:14,729
Not exactly alive. But not dead?

1437
01:11:14,762 --> 01:11:17,298
I can't but he can.

1438
01:11:17,332 --> 01:11:19,501
It's up to you. Yeah.

1439
01:11:19,534 --> 01:11:21,769
Yeah, I can't lose her.

1440
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:28,443
I need privacy to do this.

1441
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,244
Ah.

1442
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,423
That's enough. It doesn't take that long.

1443
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:00,735
Your wife is very sweet.

1444
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,506
Yeah. So, uh...

1445
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,609
I am just wondering,

1446
01:13:07,642 --> 01:13:10,311
are you guys getting along, or, uh...

1447
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:12,880
any chance of breaking up in the future?

1448
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:17,785
Danny.

1449
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:26,995
Thank you.

1450
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,397
You're welcome.

1451
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,508
Come on, open up.

1452
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,577
Who's there? I'm a friend of your son.

1453
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:45,613
I wanna help you. You want to help me?

1454
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:48,349
I've got some news for you, Grandpa.

1455
01:13:53,454 --> 01:13:55,089
Did you say Grandpa?

1456
01:14:00,528 --> 01:14:03,898
I thought all victims turned into vampires or died.

1457
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:06,434
I've never heard of anyone turning back.

1458
01:14:06,467 --> 01:14:08,469
Well, I've never known anyone firsthand.

1459
01:14:08,503 --> 01:14:11,005
But apparently, if you're young enough--

1460
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:12,740
those are useless on a stem.

1461
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:20,415
Are you really sure this isn't just Joey's rebelliousness?

1462
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:23,017
I mean, do they seem serious?

1463
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:25,653
Well, I've never seen Stacy like this before.

1464
01:14:25,687 --> 01:14:27,755
And he's so excited to be a dad.

1465
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:30,525
I believe they really are in love.

1466
01:14:30,558 --> 01:14:32,460
When did you awaken?

1467
01:14:32,493 --> 01:14:34,128
1841.

1468
01:14:34,162 --> 01:14:36,464
I survived a feeding and begged her to turn me.

1469
01:14:36,497 --> 01:14:38,599
You wanted to become a vampire?

1470
01:14:38,633 --> 01:14:41,569
It was the lesser of two infections.

1471
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,838
In 1840, there was an epidemic of cholera

1472
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:45,573
in lower Manhattan.

1473
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,443
It was a painful and degrading death.

1474
01:14:48,476 --> 01:14:51,145
My husband and sisters had all passed.

1475
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:54,449
But, miraculously, my children were fine.

1476
01:14:54,482 --> 01:14:58,553
Not to be indelicate, but I had digestive rumblings

1477
01:14:58,586 --> 01:15:00,154
that I knew were the early symptoms,

1478
01:15:00,188 --> 01:15:03,057
and orphans did not fare well in those days.

1479
01:15:03,091 --> 01:15:05,126
So did your kids survive?

1480
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:09,163
My son lived to the ripe old age of 63.

1481
01:15:09,197 --> 01:15:11,799
And my daughter married Peter Meester,

1482
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:14,001
and lived to be 99.

1483
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:16,037
Unprecedented at the time.

1484
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,673
Well, not many elderly people had strong young mothers

1485
01:15:18,706 --> 01:15:20,141
to look out for them.

1486
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:24,112
After the grandchildren, it would've been hard

1487
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,114
to stay in their lives and not scare them.

1488
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:31,219
- Did you get that?
- Got it.

1489
01:15:31,252 --> 01:15:35,022
You know, the only surefire way is to behead her.

1490
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:38,793
Everything else might just piss her off.

1491
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,762
And when Cisserus is dead,

1492
01:15:40,795 --> 01:15:43,631
Stacy will be a normal girl.

1493
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,601
Normal for Stacy.

1494
01:15:46,634 --> 01:15:49,904
But, what happens to you, then?

1495
01:15:51,606 --> 01:15:53,674
I saved my kids.

1496
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:55,176
Let's go save yours.

1497
01:15:56,811 --> 01:15:58,846
Here you go. Here's your family tree.

1498
01:16:01,616 --> 01:16:03,217
Your living descendants.

1499
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:06,554
A great-great-great-great grandson.

1500
01:16:06,587 --> 01:16:09,924
A drug addict. Incarcerated.

1501
01:16:09,957 --> 01:16:14,695
Four doctors. One in Doctors Without Borders.

1502
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:17,165
Two professors, four teachers,

1503
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,200
and in the House of Representatives,

1504
01:16:19,233 --> 01:16:22,170
Jane Rutherford, who chairs several committees.

1505
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:23,771
She looks like you.

1506
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,974
Thank you.

1507
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,678
All right, leave the guns.

1508
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:33,648
Bring the axes, hatchets, blades.

1509
01:16:33,681 --> 01:16:37,652
All right, let's go get this dried up bitch.

1510
01:16:39,654 --> 01:16:41,756
Well, I don't go to those places much, either.

1511
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:44,859
But it just shows you can meet someone really nice.

1512
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,595
Well, I never go to those places, so...

1513
01:16:47,628 --> 01:16:49,530
I can't believe I met you, though.

1514
01:16:49,564 --> 01:16:52,266
You are beautiful. You're so sweet.

1515
01:16:53,835 --> 01:16:56,637
Would you like to sit? Oh, would I?

1516
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:01,576
Nice here. Isn't it?

1517
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:03,911
Oh.

1518
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:06,113
Isn't your wife worried about

1519
01:17:06,147 --> 01:17:08,049
where you are so late?

1520
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,219
She's on a trip and what she don't know won't hurt her.

1521
01:17:13,688 --> 01:17:15,890
Aren't you a bad boy?

1522
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,559
I can be very bad.

1523
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:21,863
So what does a dirty boy like you do for a living?

1524
01:17:21,896 --> 01:17:23,698
I'm a dentist.

1525
01:17:23,731 --> 01:17:26,601
You're a dentist?

1526
01:17:26,634 --> 01:17:28,603
What a lucky break.

1527
01:17:28,636 --> 01:17:30,676
Because I have something I'm really concerned about.

1528
01:17:30,705 --> 01:17:32,607
Can I show you?

1529
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:40,081
I've never seen anything like that in my--

1530
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:43,084
Oh, no! No!

1531
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,056
Run! Get out of here!

1532
01:17:52,393 --> 01:17:54,128
You asshole.

1533
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:55,830
Let's go.

1534
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:06,774
You bad girls.

1535
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,377
I am very disappointed in you.

1536
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:11,979
After all I've done for you,

1537
01:18:12,013 --> 01:18:15,016
this is how you pay me back?

1538
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:18,619
Are you okay?

1539
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:20,655
Who treats their stem like this?

1540
01:18:26,193 --> 01:18:28,095
Those needed gunpowder!

1541
01:18:37,705 --> 01:18:39,640
Duck!

1542
01:18:44,979 --> 01:18:46,647
Oh, my God. We did it.

1543
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:49,650
No. You guys, we have to get her into the tomb.

1544
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:50,885
Help me. Okay, okay.

1545
01:18:50,918 --> 01:18:53,654
Argh.

1546
01:18:53,688 --> 01:18:55,790
When did my ass get so flat?

1547
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,896
Can I just say-- ow!

1548
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,802
Wait-- what are we gonna do about the body?

1549
01:19:07,835 --> 01:19:08,970
Oh, it'll die in a minute.

1550
01:19:09,003 --> 01:19:10,404
Where were you?

1551
01:19:10,438 --> 01:19:12,239
What? You asked me to get a chainsaw.

1552
01:19:12,273 --> 01:19:14,275
I get halfway here and realize it needs gasoline.

1553
01:19:14,308 --> 01:19:15,276
Do you know where to get gasoline

1554
01:19:15,309 --> 01:19:16,711
at 4:00 in the morning?

1555
01:19:16,744 --> 01:19:18,322
Why didn't you get it where you got the saw?

1556
01:19:18,346 --> 01:19:20,047
Because I thought you plugged them in.

1557
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:21,315
What am I, a lumberjack?

1558
01:19:21,349 --> 01:19:23,818
In the forest, you're plugging things in?

1559
01:19:23,851 --> 01:19:26,053
- Yes, like a hairdryer or a--
- Joey!

1560
01:19:36,297 --> 01:19:39,834
Come on! Come on! I don't believe this.

1561
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,675
Hurry! Hurry.

1562
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,714
Okay, close it...

1563
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:58,986
Whoa. Okay, let's go.

1564
01:20:04,225 --> 01:20:05,826
You feel anything?

1565
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,128
No.

1566
01:20:08,195 --> 01:20:09,864
Wait.

1567
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,848
That's it?

1568
01:20:27,882 --> 01:20:28,916
You've aged 20 years?

1569
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:32,053
Well, I didn't drink, smoke, do drugs, or sunbathe.

1570
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:42,830
Oh, well, maybe your genes just aren't as good.

1571
01:20:42,863 --> 01:20:45,032
But with Botox and laser resurfacing...

1572
01:20:48,536 --> 01:20:50,871
Don't tell me you lied about your age.

1573
01:20:50,905 --> 01:20:52,139
Oh, come on.

1574
01:20:52,173 --> 01:20:54,875
Who the hell names their kid Goody anymore?

1575
01:20:57,912 --> 01:20:59,780
You won't get any older, will you?

1576
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:01,382
It's okay.

1577
01:21:01,415 --> 01:21:03,451
I've been around long enough.

1578
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,052
I'm tired.

1579
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,155
I should've known.

1580
01:21:08,189 --> 01:21:10,124
Every time I turned on the History Channel,

1581
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:12,093
all I saw was stuff about Hitler.

1582
01:21:13,594 --> 01:21:16,530
Don't be sad. I was gonna go into the sun before I met you.

1583
01:21:16,564 --> 01:21:18,799
You showed me how to have fun.

1584
01:21:26,941 --> 01:21:28,876
Is there anything you want?

1585
01:21:28,909 --> 01:21:30,111
Yes.

1586
01:21:30,144 --> 01:21:32,012
I don't wanna be here.

1587
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:34,348
I want to be in the center of things.

1588
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:36,150
Let's go.

1589
01:21:47,428 --> 01:21:49,130
You all right?

1590
01:22:01,575 --> 01:22:04,979
You all right? How do you feel?

1591
01:22:05,012 --> 01:22:06,981
Hungry.

1592
01:22:07,014 --> 01:22:09,917
How about one of those pretzel things?

1593
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:11,495
Joey, can you go get one of those pretzel things?

1594
01:22:11,519 --> 01:22:13,287
Of course. Thanks.

1595
01:22:55,396 --> 01:22:57,364
Goody. Goody.

1596
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:13,714
Oh, my God.

1597
01:25:11,265 --> 01:25:12,766
Oh!

1598
01:25:14,101 --> 01:25:15,703
Hey, I saw that.

1599
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,638
What? She looked at me. I wasn't doing anything.

1600
01:25:17,671 --> 01:25:19,206
Need I remind you that I gave you

1601
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,750
the best years of my life? Best years of my life.

1602
01:25:20,774 --> 01:25:23,277
Yeah, and I'm not talking five, 10 years here.

1603
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,812
We're talking infinity.

1604
01:25:24,845 --> 01:25:26,347
Do you have any idea what that's like?

1605
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:28,649
I'm starting to get an idea.

1606
01:25:32,152 --> 01:25:34,321
All right, Goody. Watch this.

1607
01:25:38,492 --> 01:25:40,094
Too frightening.

1608
01:25:40,127 --> 01:25:42,396
Is it too frightening?

1609
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,231
Bleh!

1610
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:53,340
Well, you got Grandpa that time.
